            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:62983:3"/>
                  <p>And when I came to a Reſolution to Publiſh the ſame, I thought it my Duty to <hi>Dedicate</hi> it to thy ſelf, of whoſe Moderation I have had many years Experience, &amp; of thy Chriſtian Charity towards ſuch as differ from thee in ſome Points of <hi>Religious Matters,</hi> of which I can produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witneſſes, to wit, all my Friends in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who lately ſtood Convict of <hi>Recuſancy</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> wherein thou didſt not act the Part of the Proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who Salute their Brethren only; nor yet of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe of Pitty eaſily paſs by, without taking any notice of the Suffering of others; nay, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times are the Cauſe of their Sufferings: But like the Merciful and Sympathizing <hi>Samaritan,</hi> took

                  <p>AMongſt all the endowments beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Sons of men, nothing is to have a higher price and value put upon it, than that we call <hi>Conſcience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the immediate reference it hath to the pleaſing or diſpleaſing of the great God, and thoſe more noble concerns of a better life; and alſo the irreſiſtible Influence it hath upon our ſelves, to determine our well or ill being here. CONSCIENCE is an Ability in the Underſtanding of man, by a Reflect Act to judge of himſelf in all he does, as to his acceptance or rejection with God; this is the inward Rule he hath to walk by: And 'tis but reaſonable to believe, mankind bound to ſteer their courſe, by what (upon the utmoſt improvement of their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) they know, and believe beſt.</p>

So that the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the underſtanding is ſtill the guide of the Conſcience; for when we become once convinced that this or that is Gods will, my underſtanding reflects back to my ſelf, and tells me, <hi>This is my Duty in reference to it,</hi> and ſo comes in upon each man the obligation of that we call <hi>Conſcience;</hi> which is indeed ſo unavoidable a Reflection, ſuitable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and impreſſion the underſtanding lies under, that no man hath power in himſelf, if he would to eſcape it; <hi>Conſcientiam non eſſe judicium theoreticum, quo verum à falſo ſimpliciter diſcernitur, ſed puncticum, quo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulariter illa cognitio applicatur ab homine ad illud, quod ipſi vel bonum, vel malum eſt, ut ſit interna Regula, dirigens voluntatem: Ameſ.

Conſci.</hi> That there was at firſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> a clear and perfect knowledge of God, and of himſelf, is not to be doubted; and that there was this Reflect Act in <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge, that he fully viewed and beheld himſelf, and knew in what a happy eſtate God had made him, is alſo clear; and that this exerciſe of his knowledge alſo, in a way of Conſcience, he had to tell him, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and did well in whatſoever he did; but that equal reflection of mans Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, both towards good and evil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the one, and condemning the other, was firſt introduced when he did eat of the <hi>Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil;</hi> which was ſo called by anticipation, becauſe by the ſin committed in eating of it, <hi>Adam,</hi> who knew nothing before, neither in himſelf, nor any other Creature, but what was perfectly good, came to the miſerable knowledge of good and evil. <hi>Evil,</hi> before he could not know; for till he had ſinned, there could be no ſuch thing preſented to his view; but in that act of his ſinning, he ſaw the greateſt Evil, and the root of all other Evil; what was Good alſo, by his fall he came to know in another manner than before; for before he knew it only ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, but now as it ſtood in a direct contrariety and oppoſition unto Evil. That perfect knowledge man had at the firſt ſo far retains,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62983:7"/> ſince the fall, its excellent nature, as to be a diſtinguiſher between Good and Evil, and a conſtant witneſs for God in his ſoul, and by ſecret reference to what he was at firſt, tells him what he ſtill ought to be: And this is the thing we call <hi>Conſcince,</hi> which as it is the beſt thing left in man by far, ſince the fall, ſo 'tis the nobleſt and worthieſt thing the world hath left in it, and which above all others ought to be cheriſhed and valued, as that whereby God is moſt acknowledged, each man in his own breſt moſt quieted and ſettled, and mankind beſt enabled to live peaceably in ſociety and converſe together.</p>
                  <p>That it hath continued amongſt men ever ſince the Fall, is plain, if we conſider, that even in the darkeſt times of divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, before any Law from God was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this knowledge men had of themſelves, in reference to God, was a Law unto them. Their natural light, derived to them from their firſt creation, dictating to them what they ought to do, and what not, and enabling them to paſs a judgment upon themſelves, of their due behaviour towards God; and this the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> calls <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which will either excuſe them, or accuſe them in the great Judgment day, when the ſecrets of mens hearts ſhall be made known.</p>
                  <p>There be ſince mans fall two things emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62983:7"/> left in him; A ſence and knowledge of God, though remote, and that two ways: <hi>firſt,</hi> by Inſtinct in his very compoſition and conſtitution, God making him at firſt in his own Image: and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by the uſe of his reaſon, in beholding the works of creation and providence, which he does daily behold, and converſe with, and which do eminently preach God unto him; the other thing is a ſence of pleaſing or diſpleaſing God, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what his underſtanding tells him is good or ill, and this is to each man a Law; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in that place of the <hi>Romans</hi> tells us, <hi>That thoſe that have not the Law written, are a Law unto themſelves, and do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When afterwards men came to be under a law written, and the knowledge of Gods mind concerning man was more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, every man came to have a larger view of his duty, and clearer reflection upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reference to it, and ſo came to have a more enlightned Conſcience, ſuitable to the enlargedneſs of his underſtanding in his walking before God.</p>
                  <p>This then being premiſed, that mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge which he had at firſt, does ſtill retain a taſte of, and a diſcerning prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple between good and evil, and does enable a man to judge of himſelf, in reference to his pleaſing or diſpleaſing of God, by the one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62983:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the other; and that every man hath more or leſs in him of that we call <hi>Conſcience;</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſome particular caſes, whereby often endeavouring to reſiſt and oppoſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, God in juſt judgment takes away the uſe of it) and that Conſcience is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the underſtanding, and the light thereof.</p>
                  <p>We will conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That men do, and always have differed in their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and apprehenſions, and ſo in their Conſciences about divine things, and their duty to God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> what the grounds and reaſons are, upon which men come to differ: And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How far men are to be tolerated, and indulged one by another, in ſuch variety and difference of knowledge and conſcience. For the firſt, we ſhall find it too obviouſly plain, ſo to have been in all times; A man muſt have ſome ill will, either to himſelf or his Reader, that ſhould ſpend much time in the proof of it. If we look into thoſe early times, before any Law was written, though all men had one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inſtinct of God in their nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had the ſame outward <hi>Mediums</hi> of the knowledge of God, which were the works of Creation and Providence; for there is no place where their Voice ſounded not, yet doubtleſs the various Apprehenſions of God, and of mans duty to him were very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62983:8"/> great; ſome improving thoſe common Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Divinity, to more reverent thoughts of a Deity, and a more ſober virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of living, by their natural light; and others ſo far degenerating from them, as that when they know God, and might have known more of him, they glorified him not as God, but turned the glory of the true and incorruptible God into mock-Deities, of Birds and Beaſts, and ſo came to be given up to all manner of Evil. Such who lived in thoſe dayes, and were by dreams, viſions, voices, and otherwiſe particularly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had other kind of apprehenſions of God, and principles of Conſcience ſuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; which yet could reach no further than themſelves, nor be obliging to others far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they could juſtifie thoſe divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in their own nature, or by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their own teſtimony gain belief, and perſwade men thereunto.</p>
                  <p>When aferwards the Law came to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Stone, which was from the beginning written in the Heart, and was in truth no other than a tranſcript of the Law of Nature, and the Light thereof; yet what great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety do we find in the Expoſition of it, and what various Principles derived from it? he is a great ſtranger to all Rabbinical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who knows not the wide compaſs of the Jewiſh Debates and Controverſies. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62983:9"/> ſince the times of the largeſt and fulleſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Mind and Will of God in the days of the Goſpel, do we not ſee, that knowledge hath multiplied Diviſion? What great variety of thoughts have ariſen amongſt men, not only concerning thoſe more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Notions of the Order and Diſcipline of the Goſpel Church, but of moſt of the other Doctrines and Truths of Religion? And ſo general have the miſ-apprehenſions been, that have poſſeſſed men in theſe things, that ſometimes we find in the Chriſtian Church, Truth ſhut up, and thruſt into a very narrow Corner; and ſometimes an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius,</hi> and ſome very few oppoſing the torrent of miſtakes, with which the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian underſtandings were poſſeſſed. And ſtill the variety of mens Apprehenſions have produced the ſame variety in ſeveral ſorts of Conſciences, and the effects of it. If we ſeriouſly ponder the reaſons of theſe things, we ſhall find them to come under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral heads, in the viewing of which, we may arrive at ſome ſatisfaction, in the ſecond thing propoſed, which is to know, how ſuch uneven, diſproportionate Thoughts, Opinions and Conſciences come to be amongſt men.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and great account that may be given of it, is this: An innate infirmity in the Soul of man ſince his fall, not to be able always to make a right judgment of things,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62983:9"/> but to receive various impreſſions in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding faculty (by reaſon of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and imperfection of it) according to all the ſeveral accidents and circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to its information, and the object 'tis converſant about. <hi>Adam</hi> in his naming the Creatures, and what-elſe he did before the fall, was not capable of a miſtake; but man ſince lies very open to all deluſion and deceit, being not able always to repreſent to himſelf in his underſtanding-faculty, all thoſe things that ſhould be known to make up a perfect judgment, nor if he could do ſo, were he able by the intrinſick ſtrength of that faculty, perfectly and infallibly to judge of what ſhould evidently appear before him; nor laſtly, to remain fixed in any determination, being not only ſubject to alter and change by ſeeing farther, and having more preſented to his view than what he at the firſt knew, but alſo in his own nature now, become mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and apt to change in his beſt and trueſt reſolves: And from ſuch a womb of infirmity, 'tis not hard to conceive what various and differing thoughts may be born.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great variety there is of ſuitable means to operate upon ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Soul, and to prevail over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of mens underſtanding, to lead them in ſeveral Paths. This we ſhall eaſily find, if we conſider the ſeveral poſtures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62983:10"/> mankind is ſettled in, as to Education, Company, Studies, and many ſuch acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial matters, by which the minds of men are variouſly ſeaſoned and engaged in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; and ſo come to have differing foundations laid of Conſcience, according to impreſſions received thereby. And where (as in moſt it is) very weak and ordinary motives prevail, and no larger compaſs is taken to ſettle the judgment, than thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential means that firſt prevail with us, yet as poſitive an obligation of Conſcience ariſeth from ſuch things, as from any whatſoever; there can be no perſwaſion ſo impotent, but may meet with ſome capacities, over which it may eaſily have dominion, and the bounds of ſuch mens knowledge, though never ſo mean, muſt needs be a rule to the Conſcience; ſo that to imagine all mens Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould be the ſame, is to imagine all men to be educated a like, all Company to talk a like, and all Books to be written a like, and that all other things, that work upon the minds of men, ſhould all concenter to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beſides all this, there is an in-bred diſpoſition in the Souls of men, according to the Bodies they dwell in, to apprehend and believe diverſly of things, without any other outward help to ſuch a variety; ſome men being naturally prone to believe ſome things,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62983:10"/> and others to imbibe thoſe of a contrary Nature; and this is to be found without much difficulty, in the ſeveral conſtitutions and compoſures of men, where we ſhall find their thoughts and opinions holding great correſpondence with, and bearing much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their natural inclinations and tempers, and at ſeveral times ſeveral thoughts prevailing, according as the concommitant Humours of nature are predominant in them; ſo that let a man but phyloſophically view over the divers humors in mens Bodies, ſuch as make men cholerick, flegmatick, or the like, and the wonderful mixture of thoſe humors, in the various Temperament of them, and he will not be much to ſeek for the various Thoughts, Opinions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences that are in the World; and to force men out of theſe, through any door than that of the underſtanding, and means ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto, is to force them out of their very nature and exiſtence; that Soul in man that was at firſt Lord over the Body, and could receive no <hi>ſophiſtication</hi> from it, takes now a great tincture from thence, and ſavours much in all its operations of the veſſel 'tis kept in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us ſeriouſly ponder the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful variety there is in that inward divine illumination, afforded to men more or leſs, as God pleaſeth, by which their judgments
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62983:11"/> and conſciences are in ſeveral meaſures ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and determined: As nothing can give us a clearer account of that variety there is in the World, in divine things, ſo nothing can be more prevailing upon us, to have compaſſion upon men ſeverally informed and perſwaded, than when we conſider, God affordeth divine light ſeverally to them, as he pleaſeth, and gives it in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, little or much, ſeems beſt to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and by making men of ſeveral growths and ſtatures in divine knowledge, does ſeem to let us know, he would have men of ſeveral ſizes and attainments in that kind, to live quietly together in the World.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being able, in ſome meaſure, to diſcover to us the grounds of theſe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Principles we find amongſt men, we will go on to the third and chief thing we have in purſuit by this diſcourſe, which is a ſerious Enquiry, <hi>How far men are to be Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one by another, whoſe Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences about Divine things are found to differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> in it ſelf conſidered (being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Underſtanding under ſuch a kind of Exerciſe, as is before deſcribed) is ſuch a thing as can by no means come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any poſſibility of Force or Reſtraint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its own Bounds, and is as much out of the reach of all humane Power, as the Soul it ſelf is, and therefore is choſen of God to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62983:11"/> be the Witneſs, which he gives to himſelf amongſt the Sons of men, of their due beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards him, and is a thing neither in the power of others, nor in the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; no man can point out what another ſhall believe, nor can he chuſe out his own Belief; but ſtill the Underſtanding gives in its teſtimony by the Conſcience, though in actings the Will may ſometimes prevail againſt it. This is that which chiefly differs a man, as to his relativeneſs to God, from other Creatures, and is that whereby God keeps up his ſolemn claim of Soveraignity over us, in our own breaſts, by ſuch means as we can no way oppoſe nor avoid. This Dominion of God was never delegated to any ſubſtitute upon Earth, nor was there ſince the World began a judgment entruſted in any hands over the Conſciences of men, nor was it indeed under a poſſibility to be, ſince no man, nor men, with the exiſtence of humane Power, could ever come to know the ſtate of another mans Conſcience, nor the manifold Circumſtances (only open to a divine Eye) relating to it; and therefore does <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> wholly diſclaim the exerciſe of ſuch a Power.</p>
                  <p>The ſimple actings therefore of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence abſtractedly conſidered, are not capable of a forcible impreſſion from without; nor need any man fear the loſs of liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62983:12"/> in that ſenſe of it, nor reckon himſelf under an obligation to any indulgence for it, ſince a donation of it from any, will with no more reality afford it to me, than a reſtraint from them will any way actually take it from me.</p>
                  <p>That which will (as moſt proper and genuine to the preſent enquiry propoſed) come under conſideration, will be, How far the products and effects of Conſcience, in mens actings in purſuance of it, are to be indulged, and how far reſtrained; and this will all come under two Heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>How far men are to be ſuffered to do, or not to do thoſe things which they ſay they are in Conſcience obliged to do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>How far men are to be urged by commands to do ſuch things which they ſay they are in Conſcience obliged not to do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a punctual clear Anſwer to theſe Queſtions will be a Travel of great peril un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, none that have any way verſed themſelves in ſuch Controverſies will deny, and therefore the better to ſecure our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs herein, it will be neceſſary chiefly and principally to reflect upon the Magiſtrate, and the Power he is entruſted withal; this method will carry its own evidence ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with it: If we conſider the power that mankind hath over each other, is exerciſed by him, and that the ſucceſs of this notion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62983:12"/> and the influence both of freedom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint depends ſolely upon him, and that the power of Princes and Magiſtrates do actually bind and looſe in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I ſay, if we conſider this, we ſhall ſoon make a diſcovery, that (finding out what the Magiſtrate may do, and what he may not do in Religious affairs) will give us a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this matter. In the proſecution of this, theſe ſeveral things ſhall be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To make it evident, that Magiſtracy is an Inſtitution grounded upon the Light of nature, and how far he may and ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by that both negatively and poſitively in theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Magiſtrate by becoming Chriſtian receives no addition of Power to what he had before, only ſtands bound to an improved exerciſe of his Power, ſuitable to the light he then receives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To diſcover ſome eminent miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken extreams about the Magiſtrates Power in Religion, which have miſerably involved us.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To ſhew how far the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, under the Goſpel, ſhould and ought to act about Religion, and wherein he is not to interpoſe his Power, the right ſtating whereof is the true and ſolid Foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all true <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is built.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62983:13"/>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>That Magiſtracy and Government is an Inſtitution grounded upon the Light of Nature,</hi> is eaſie enough to be made appear, the firſt riſe of it being in Families, where it was wholly natural and paternal; and therefore it is that the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein all ſubjection to Superiors is commanded, is comprehended under the <hi>Obedience of Children,</hi> required to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that being the firſt Magiſtratical Power exerciſed: That firſt Power and Authority God gave <hi>Adam,</hi> upon the Fall, over the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being a diſtinguiſhing Power between the two Sexes, and not properly any <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Power</hi> relating to a Community. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there came to be ſeveral divided Families in the World, they found a neceſſity of a Power, that might have a larger and farther extent than that in each Family; which could be no otherwiſe grounded, than by a joynt and common conſent, God having not by particular deſignation appointed any to rule over the World; and no one Family could claim a right to rule over another, nor could the firſt born in any family exerciſe any Power, or extend his Dominion farther than that particular Family: The reaſon whereof ſeems plain, becauſe that paternal Power which is originally in a family, is not ſucceſſive; there is no ſucceſſion of that power Parents have over their Children, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62983:13"/> Maſters have over their Servants (which is the ground of Family-Government) farther than thoſe relations ſtill reach; Hence it is the Power a Parent might exerciſe in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as a Father and a Maſter, he cannot exerciſe upon any of his Kindred, or other collateral Relations in any degree further, and therefore that kind of Dominion muſt needs reſt circumſcribed within the bounds of each particular Family; and that more extenſive Government of many Families to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, was by a joynt-coalition and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, dictated by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for general good; there being ſcarce any thing a more neceſſary direction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for mans own Preſervation and Good, ſince his Fall, than to aſſociate himſelf in a Community under one common Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>How the Light of Nature did at the firſt operate upon men, to convince them of a neceſſity to joyn together in a ſubjection to Superiors, and how greatly their intereſt lay in ſuch a ſubjection, relative to ſuch a publick Dominion, we may ſome-what diſcover, if we conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Earth was at the firſt the Gift of the great Creator to the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and what every man firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed was his own, and whatever he could by his labour produce from it (the ſame Law that is to this day, to the firſt Diſcoverers of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62983:14"/> any unpoſſeſſed part of the World:) Now the only way to preſerve men in ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and to make good that firſt Law of Gods donation, was to have by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a publick power to take care of it, and reſtrain the violence and exorbitant injuſtice, that would otherwiſe have filled the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When private differences came to ariſe between man and man, between cauſe and cauſe, it would prove impoſible to end any ſtrife, while each man would be a Judge in his own caſe, and therefore it was found impracticable for men to live without a third Judgment, which did neceſſarily point them to a Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Man was not only a ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in himſelf, made to live in ſociety, and prompted by particular inclination to it, but each man came to ſee men had common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns one with another, and Intereſts of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick nature, beyond the bounds of their own particular Families; &amp; there could be no way found out to capacitate them, to enjoy thoſe common advantages they might afford each to other, but by imbodying themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and creating a publick Relation each to other in one joynt-ſociety, the very being of which muſt needs lie in having one to rule over it, and to exerciſe that publick care, requiſite to its preſervation, to which no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62983:14"/> mans private power or concern either could or ought to lead him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ſenſible good each Family found in that Paternal Regiment exerciſed within it ſelf, might well induce them to fall into that more general; and to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under one Political Father, in whoſe care and protection they might live ſecured.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many other neceſſary inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the common ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men, induced the power of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the reaſon of obeying. That God that afforded to each Creature a capacity large enough for its own preſervation, did not leave Man without ſufficient light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this great Engine of his ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Well may we then look upon the power of Magiſtracy, as the greateſt and moſt tranſcendant of all humane things, and pay the due tribute of all Reverence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it, as being the Soveraign Power of God, exerciſed in a way of Vicegerency amongſt men, and that wherein the peace and quiet of mankind is moſt neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded?</p>
                  <p>The Law and Light of Nature, having thus from the beginning placed the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in his Throne, the ſame alſo did lead and guide him to the exerciſe of his Power, by bringing him under this obligation, to do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62983:15"/> whatſoever ſhould be found neceſſary to the good of mankind, both in their private and publick capacity, and reſtrain whatſoever is deſtructive to it; this as it brings Princes and Magiſtrates to a tye of duty, ſo is the donation of this Power exceeding large and ample.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> thing in which the power of the Magiſtrate is naturally exerted, is in his own preſervation, wherein his Power is <hi>Paramount</hi> to all pretenſions whatſoever; As in Nature each mans ſupream Law lies in ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is bid to love his Neighbour but as himſelf; So politically in Magiſtracy the preſervation of it ſelf in its Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and the exerciſes thereof, is the firſt thing 'tis led to look after; he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf in order to that preſervation he is to afford to others. 'Twere very abſurd to ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate bound to tolerate any thing deſtructive to his being, no pretence of Conſcience is here to be ſuffered, 'tis a practice againſt the Law of Nature, 'tis to pretend Conſcience to annihilate mankind; God hath not, nor will not promulge Laws to interfere one with another, nor will he ever reveal any thing againſt the ſtanding Law of Nature [it being the remains of mans excellent creation at firſt] but what ſhall heighten and improve it to a further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Herein therefore Princes and States
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62983:15"/> are ſufficiently ſecured by a power inherent in their very being, that no abuſed preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a Liberty for Conſcience can ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or diſturb them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The extent of the Magiſtrates power reacheth to a total ſuppreſſion of all moral evil, and encouragement of all moral good; and that for theſe Reaſons: Firſt, moral evil is an abomination to every mans Conſcience, and therefore ought to be much more ſo to the Magiſtrate, who hath the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of ſuppreſſing and puniſhing it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, moral evil and vice is moſt injurious to mankind, and deſtructive to that well-being and quiet the Magiſtrate is bound to provide for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It brings down ſenſible and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Judgments upon Perſons and Societies, with a voice eaſie enough to be heard by any natural ear, and therefore the Magiſtrate by the very Light of Nature, is loudly enough called upon to ſuppreſs it. This we have clear enough ſet down in the 13th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Magiſtrate is ſaid <hi>to be a terrour to evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well;</hi> the Magiſtrates power is there fully aſſerted, but it ſeems to be but the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had before, his Commiſſion ſeems only to be renewed with the ſame power he had from the beginning; that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks nothing of the power of Magiſtrates,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62983:16"/> beyond what the Light of Nature gives them, ſeems to be very clear in two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that he inſtanceth in the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> power that then was; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſets down nothing that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is to do, but what the Light and Law of Nature doth directly guide him unto; That the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Magiſtracy in general, is plain, and that he ſpeaks of it in the preſent inſtance of the then <hi>Roman</hi> Power, is as plain; now if all that belongs to the Magiſtracy in the abſtract, had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the <hi>Roman</hi> power, as to the right of it, the inſtance had been no way proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate nor right. The Apoſtle writing to <hi>Rome,</hi> no doubt intended to declare the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Goſpel to be ſuch, as taught all ſubjection to the Emperor; he ſays, <hi>The Powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi> ſpeaking in the preſent ſenſe of thoſe that then were, and he ſays, <hi>For this cauſe pay you Tribute;</hi> that is, the preſent Tax you pay the Roman Emperor is upon this very account; ſo that he carries on the inſtance of Magiſtracy all along in the Roman Heathen power. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſpeaks of nothing to be done by the Magiſtrate, but what the Light of nature dictates, and what was the duty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror then to do; to execute wrath upon him that doth evil, and to encourage thoſe that do well; wherein he is a Miniſter of God to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62983:16"/> us for very much good. By this we ſee then, this farther power of reſtraint in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in his natural conſtitution, that being to ſuppreſs all moral evil, and encourage virtue, he is bound not to ſuffer, upon any falſe pretenſions of Conſcience whatſoever, any practices that diſcourage the one, or fall within the guilt of the other.</p>
                  <p>Theſe forementioned and unqueſtionable generals do contain in them the negative and poſitive execution of the Magiſtates natural power, in things purely moral and political. How far he is by the Light of Nature obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about the Religious concerns of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and wherein the Light of Nature lays an Arreſt upon him, not to proceed, that ſo the due liberty of each mans Conſcience may be ſecured, will come under a more pertinent conſideration, in a following part of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. We ſee by theſe things, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate negatively impowered in an ample manner in his firſt conſtitution, over all things relating to the moral and political good of mankind. The Light of Nature excludes all ſuch Principles from the leaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, which make men ceaſe to be true Subjects to the State, or good Common-wealths-men in relation to others: Liberty of Conſcience is beſt ſecur'd by diſclaiming ſuch who neither by natural or divine Law, can make any juſt pretence to it; 'Tis only to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62983:17"/> given in things divine and ſupernatural, ſuch as neither deſtroy nor diſturb the civil and political Intereſts and Rights of men.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing propoſed about the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate will have no hardſhip to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>That a Magistrate by becoming Christian hath no addition of power to what he had before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Magiſtracy is the ſame, and as legitimated amongſt <hi>Heathens</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, when Chriſtian, exerciſes the power he had before otherwiſe, but receives no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of power to his Office; Chriſt in the Goſpel hath made no alteration in <hi>Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power,</hi> nor hath he given any addition to it, when exerciſed by Chriſtian hands; but a Magiſtrate, when Chriſtian, is bound to exert his power in a way ſuitable to the light he then hath: He that hath no other than the light of nature, hath as much power about Religion as if he were Chriſtian, and is to take as much care of the Souls of his Subjects, ſuitable to that Light, as any Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is to do, ſuitable to his. The power a Parent hath over his Child, a Maſter over his Servant, a Prince over his Subjects, is no more when they become Chriſtian than it was before, only that power muſt be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exerciſed, according to that improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of light Chriſtianity brings with it. All natural and moral Power was the ſame from the beginning, though God was not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62983:17"/> pleaſed to ſet that power diſtinctly in a Law written, till long after the light of nature gave a plentiful information about theſe things: The duty of all ſuch relations, in the performance mutually of them amongſt men, is greatly furthered by the <hi>Light of the Goſpel,</hi> but the duty is ſtill the ſame; ſeveral things do evidently evince this general Truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1st,</hi> All natural and moral Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to men as men, only ſo conſidered, and not as Chrſtians, and are fully compleat and perfect amongſt mankind, both in the power of the one, and the duty of the other, without any reference to any Perſwaſion in Religion, or other Qualification whatever.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> It appears from hence, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Goſpel reveals to be the duty of ſuch relations each to other, we find practiſed by the light and law of nature from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, theſe things being of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to uphold the frame and policy of mankind, God had naturally endowed them with a ſufficient diſcovery of his mind about them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> It appears to be ſo, becauſe Chriſtians are obliged by the Laws of the Goſpel to give the ſame obedience, and perform the ſame duties in theſe Relations, to Unbelievers, that they are to Believers; the Goſpel ſpeaks of theſe things without diſtinction: Subjects
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62983:18"/> are commanded to <hi>obey Heathen Magiſtrates in all things lawful</hi> [and we are to obey <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> no farther;] Servants are commanded, with the utmoſt duty of Servants, to obey unbelieving Maſters; and ſo Wives to be ſubject to unbelieving Husbands; all which declares theſe Relations perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in mankind, as ſuch, and no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to any other Qualification whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two preliminary conſiderations of the Magiſtrate; <hi>1ſt,</hi> That he has his original in the light and law of Nature: <hi>2dly,</hi> That his power and being is thereby perfect and compleat, and that Chriſtianity gives no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Power to ſuch an Office, will much further the right ſtating the chief and laſt thing propoſed, <hi>How far a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, under the Goſpel, is impowered negatively and poſitively in theſe things?</hi> Before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to which, I ſhall come to the third thing intended, which is, <hi>To ſhew how ſome eminent Miſtakes about the Magiſtrates Power in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious things, have involved us into very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and pernicious Extremities:</hi> A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which may be had in theſe three things, into which the various writings and diſcourſes of that ſubject have chiefly iſſued themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Some do make the <hi>Magiſtrate the ſole Judge of all Spiritual matters;</hi> aſcribe to him <hi>the power of ſetling what Government he pleaſes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62983:18"/> in the Church, appointing Officers in it, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all differences in Religious things, ſuppreſſing by his power all Errors and Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding all matters that appertain to the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort, with an equal warmth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Magiſtrates Power in Religious things, but ſay, <hi>'Tis never to be exerciſed but in a perfect ſubſervency to the Church; and that whatſoever the Church determines, he is bound to execute by the temporal Sword, as the great Law of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> ſort, as wide of the Truth as either of the other, ſay poſitively, <hi>The Magiſtrate hath nothing at all to do in Religious concerns, that he is a meer civil Officer to take care of mens civil Intereſts, and hath nothing to do with things of a ſpiritual nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That all theſe Principles have produced hurtful effects, and that the truth lies diſtant from them all, will be found in a diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them. The firſt does little leſs than revive in the Magiſtrate now, much of that power Chriſt himſelf, and the Apoſtles by his delegation, exerciſed at firſt, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Goſpel Church; and unleſs it can be punctually made appear, where in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Chriſt hath ſubſtituted the Magiſtrate to exerciſe ſuch a dominion over his Houſe, it will ſoberly be found a dangerous Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Kingly Office; 'tis one thing to take care of the execution of what Chriſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62983:19"/> hath already ſetled, and another to make Laws and Cuſtoms about thoſe things: This opinion, as it is by many late Writers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, diſſolves all Eccleſiaſtical Regiment, and annexeth the Government of the Church to the civil Power, or indeed drowns the Church into the State, or at leaſt mixes them as much or more than they were mixed together under the Judaical policy. What ever Government the Magiſtrate ſettles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Eccleſiaſtical, but Civil, if it be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to what is already divinely appointed; if it be not, then its not the ſetling, but the executing of what is already ſetled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will ſay, that Chriſt entruſted him to ſettle the Eccleſiaſtical Government of his Church; and that will ſeem not a little ſtrange, that the Magiſtrate, who is no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Officer ſet in the Church, nor cannot himſelf adminiſter in executing the leaſt thing within it, ſhould have ſuch a ſupream Power over it. Either Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did ſettle a Government in the Church, or they did not; if they did, the Magiſtrate, as well as others, is obliged by it; if they did not, but that 'tis left to the Magiſtrate, he has a greater power, at leaſt in the exerciſe of it, than ever they had: For if we ſuppoſe, they had power to ſettle a Government, but did not think fit to exert that power, but left it to the Magiſtrate, his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62983:19"/> power in the execution of it is greater than theirs. 'Tis much that the infallible Wiſdom of Chriſt and his Apoſtles could not better find out an order for the Goſpel Church than to leave it to the mercy of every Magiſtrates diſcretion; and 'tis equally to be wondred at, that an Officer of ſuch neceſſary import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Church, as to ſettle the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ſhould be wanting when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was firſt planted, and every thing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary belonging to it, was preſented to accompany the Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt upon Earth, and which might any way contribute to rear up the Fabrick of the New-Teſtament Church. 'Tis much that ſuch an Officer of ſo abſolute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as this Opinion makes him, ſhould not be in the Chriſtian World for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together. If we will ſeek the meaning of this providential diſpoſal of things; may we not ſoberly think it to be, that the Goſpel was a thing wholly founded upon Spiritual Power, was compleat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and needed not any Temporal power to contribute to its perfection?</p>
                  <p>This impowering the Magiſtrate with a Superlative Authority, in ſetling what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Government of the Church, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this, That the Scripture hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Truth that is binding in this matter, but this, That what the Magiſtrate pleaſeth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62983:20"/> to ſettle in every place, that is right, [and this I am ſure the Scripture hath no where revealed] and ſo we are like to have as many diſtinct Governments, as there are States and diſtinct Kindgdoms in the World; 'tis ſtrange, thoſe that are for exact Uniformity in any one Church, ſhould lay a foundation of ſuch confuſed multiplicity in the Church Univerſal.</p>
                  <p>Either we muſt ſuppoſe, Chriſt was not faithful to reveal all that concerned the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Goſpel-Church, which God intruſted him with, or elſe that it was the Will of God there ſhould be no more reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that all ſhould be tranſiently left to the Magiſtrate. To ſay the firſt, were but to urge Blaſphemy for Reaſon; if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, 'tis to impower an Officer in ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and weighty matter, whoſe very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Church,</hi> with an ability to do it, had a futurity of three hundred years to come. During all which time, if Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſetled no Government in the Church, and there being no Chriſtian <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> that could ſettle any; How could the Church then come lawfully to have any? If it be ſaid, Where there is no Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, every Church may uſe their own diſcretion; then 'tis plain, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church under the Goſpel, hath no other bottom, than what every <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62983:20"/> and every particular Church pleaſeth; and ſo not only <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> but <hi>Churches,</hi> and indeed all the World may be their own Carvers in this weighty matter; 'Tis very hard to be credited, that the Government of the Church, which does ſo greatly relate to the preſervation of the Truth of Doctrine in it, ſhould be left to ſuch floating uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this Poſition makes all that part of the Goſpel, which lies in Precept and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident about the Rule of the Church, and what was by the Apoſtles then practiſed and commanded, to be of no uſe to us, nor obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us, farther then the Magiſtrate pleaſeth; 'tis to give him a dominion over that part of the Scriptures, and opens a door to make him (as ſome have fully done) Lord over the whole New-Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Two things are uſually ſaid to prop up this Power in the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is nothing poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Goſpel about theſe things; becauſe the Goſpel being to take place throughout the whole world, no one frame or Model of Government could be compoſed, that would conveniently fit all Perſons and Places where the Goſpel might come to be received and ſetled; and therefore the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt hath left things of that nature wholly undetermined.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62983:21"/>
                  <p>This is a thing taken for granted, and wholly without any Divine Ground to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, and is in the reaſon of the thing it ſelf inſufficient; for we find nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or practice by the Apoſtles in ſetling the Chriſtian Churches, but what will agree with any Nation or People in the World. He that will ſay, That the Order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as we there find it practiſed and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will not agree to any place; may with as much reaſon, if not more, ſay, That the receiving of the Goſpel it ſelf, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belief of it, will not agree to that place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things make it evident, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſcipline we find ſetled in the Goſpel-Churches in the Apoſtles time, muſt needs fit every place and people, and can do no hurt any where.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1ſt,</hi> It highly intends to heighten and compleat the duty incumbent on all Moral and Natural Relations; that which Chriſt hath appointed to preſerve order among Chriſtians as Chriſtians, will never hinder, but farther it amongſt men as men.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The power upon which Chriſt's Rule, ſetled in his Church, is founded, is wholly Spiritual, it can never do any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to mankind, nor claſh with any humane power, becauſe that is the Boundery of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> The thing deſigned and attained by the Order of the Goſpel-Church, is no more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62983:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> than to preſerve men in a regular capacity to enjoy all Chriſts Inſtitutions; and therefore he that will ſay, This Order will not ſute any Nation, muſt ſay in effect, None of Chriſts Inſtitutions will agree to that Nation.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> There is nothing in Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, that is properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Political Government of a State, or does any way determine the form of it, but it may be equally exerciſed under any Government whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The Religious policy of the <hi>Jews</hi> did highly relate to the State, and was commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and the ſame Government of that Church could not have been without a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conformity of the State to it, and ſo could not well reach beyond that Nation, and peculiar Country and People. But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Church, and the Rule of it, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon quite other terms, and hath its firſt Principle in that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Where ever two or three are met together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them;</hi> And there is no place nor people under the Sun, but where, with much advantage, the order of the Goſpel, as well as the Goſpel it ſelf, may be introduced.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> thing made to prop up this power in the Magiſtrate, is, Becauſe of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful difficulty we find in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about matters of this nature. This I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62983:22"/> acknowledge ſhould put us upon much enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and great indulgence to each other, but I cannot yield it a good reaſon to eſtabliſh a viſible Judge to ſettle a Civil Pope; for at laſt upon the ſame grounds it will be found out, that the Scripture in Doctrinals is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure too, and ſo the Magiſtrate muſt be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Umpire in thoſe things, and finally in all. Were once all theſe Carnal Intereſts, and Political Concerns that are now twiſted into the Government of the Church, laid by, it would be found a thing very feaſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from Scripture Precept and Example, (limitted to no particular caſe in the reaſon of it) a ſyſteme of Eccleſiaſtical Rule, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the obtaining all the holy and good ends deſigned by the Goſpel, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in a Spiritual Society, as an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical-Church; and if a Church can be ſo conſtituted (which is a thing in it ſelf of no harſhip, if men would be contented with the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and Chriſts wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in theſe things) as that Church will be moſt pure, as having nothing of humane make in it, ſo it will perfectly annihilate all thoſe pretended neceſſities for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of humane Authority about ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> hath likewiſe a farther power to ſuppreſs all Errors and Hereſies, and to eſtabliſh by force the Orthodox Truth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62983:22"/> (the Rule of which muſt needs be what he thinks to be ſo) this will inevitably follow, that there can be never any ſuch thing, as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in any caſe, or upon any terms in the world, under a <hi>Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> he ſins if he ſuffer to tolerate any thing but what he thinks punctually right.</p>
                  <p>If he be the proper Judge entruſted, firſt to judge, and then to execute his Judgment with the Temporal Power; all Liberty, to whoſoever is not of his mind, is perfectly gone: This is no other than to make the Magiſtrate's Power a meer <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> And by this means a Chriſtian Magiſtrate will prove a <hi>marvellous hurt</hi> to much of the Church where he governs; for, unleſs you will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Truth, and all ſound Chriſtians to be included in what he eſtabliſhes for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, if there be any Truth, or true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity amongſt all the other Opinions he perſecutes, they are ſure to be ſufferers, and it will ever fall out, that all thoſe that are not of the Magiſtrates Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had better live under one of <hi>Gallio's</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than under a Magiſtrate ſo practiſing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe large poſitions about the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Power have no viſible ground for themſelves in the Goſpel; and when 'tis ſaid, the reaſon of it is, becauſe there was no Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> till long after, and ſo little mention is made of his Authority in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62983:23"/> theſe things, there is nothing ſaid that can be any way ſatisfactory, becauſe what Power ſoever any ſhall exerciſe in or over the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Church, to the end of the world, muſt have its riſe and derivation from what was then eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. However, they are ſure of a popular accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they bring us to a viſible Judge, and a humane certainty, which moſt men had rather be at, than a laborious inquiry after divine Truth, in the way God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Becauſe they are poſitions that land us in a very ſafe harbour, and free us from any danger of ſuffering about thoſe things; he that thinks it his duty to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the Magiſtrates Religion, is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in that duty, that no Religion can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ever hurt him; and whoever thinks the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is Gods ſubſtitute, to determine all matters of Religion, as he pleaſeth, muſt needs think it a duty to be of his mind.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Extream about the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Power, is in aſſerting the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to have ample concerns about Religion, and a power ſufficient entruſted to him; but the manner in which it is to be exerciſed, is in a punctual ſuberviency to the Church; that is, they are to determine, and he is to execute; they are to be his eye, and he is to be their hand:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62983:23"/> As the firſt Extream debaſeth the Church, and all Eccleſiaſtical power under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates feet, and makes him the ſole Lord of all, ſo this in another extream makes the Magiſtrate a Slave to the Church; this is an unreaſonable Impoſition upon him, and gives him leſs liberty than each private Chriſtian ought to have, to oblige him to put a civil Sanction, and execute by his Authority whatever the Church decrees, whether he judge it to be right or no; this is only to make him a Sword-bearer to the Clergy: This is the great Engine, by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has inſlaved ſo much of the World; Antichriſt could never have been ſetled in his Throne, if Kingdoms had not thus given up their power to him. How ſhamefully upon this pretence, that the Civil power muſt be ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical, have the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> brought Kings and Emperors, not only to employ their power as they pleaſed, but to ſuffer all the ſcorns and indignities from them imaginable? The ſtory of what <hi>Hildebrand</hi> did to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Henry,</hi> and many others, do abundantly ſhew this. The truth is, the carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Temporal Power with the Spiritual, is that which has made all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Regiment odious and unſavoury in the noſtrils of the world in all Ages, and hath had no other effect, but to enable the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62983:24"/> 
                     <hi>Clergy,</hi> under a pretext of the power of the Goſpel, to trample (by the power of the World) mankind under their Feet. That the Civil Magiſtrate ought not to employ his power in ſuch a ſub-ordination, let theſe things be conſidered:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> This is to ſuppoſe, either an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in that Spiritual Power which Chriſt did at firſt leave in his Church, or elſe that he fails in that Promiſe of <hi>being with them to the end of the World,</hi> and continuing his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to make his Laws effectual for the end they are intended: Chriſt hath appointed the means of Converting men to the Goſpel, to be the preaching of it to them: If you will compel men by the Civil power to become Converts, it plainly intimates, we judge Chriſts way inſufficient, and uſe the other as what we judge a better. As Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Preaching the Goſpel, as the great means to bring men into the Church, ſo he hath appointed Excommunication, as the great means to caſt offenders out of the Church; and force is as unreaſonable in the one as in the other. The outward advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a man has by becoming a Chriſtian, lies in the enjoyment of all Chriſts Inſtitutions; and the puniſhment of all Goſpel-crimes, lies in being caſt out from thoſe priviledges, and undergoing the weight that Chriſt ſhall lay upon the Conſcience thereby. When a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62983:24"/> perſon is excommunicated, to deliver him over to the Temporal power, to be corporally puniſhed, muſt either be, becauſe we think Chriſts puniſhment in that caſe not enough, or elſe, becauſe our own animoſity prompts us to go farther. <hi>Chryſoſt. Serm. de Anathem.</hi> hath a pious and prudent ſaying, <hi>Dogmata impia, &amp; quae ab Hereticis profecta ſunt, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere &amp; Anathematizare opertet, hominibus autem parcendum, &amp; pro ſalute eorum orandum;</hi> that is, We muſt confute, and pronounce <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> to the wicked opinions of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but we muſt ſpare their Perſons, and pray for their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This way alters the manner of Chriſts rule under the Goſpel, which is in the Spirits and Conſciences of men; 'Tis much of Chriſts glory to rule his Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel by a Spiritual power; 'tis that power makes a man a Chriſtian; 'tis that power in all Goſpel Inſtitutions, that keeps men in their due obedience unto Chriſt, and 'tis that power carries the ſting of the puniſhment, when men are caſt out of the Church: 'tis indeed that power does all under the Goſpel; and to bring in the Temporal Sword, is to make the weapons of the Goſpel, not mighty through God, but mighty through the Magiſtrates power, and wholly to alter the nature of the Goſpel, and all its Inſtitutions; 'tis to arm the Church
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62983:25"/> with Weapons Chriſt never gave her, and to make her a Military, rather than a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſe but this truth, That all Churches, even the pureſt, are in the execution of Chriſts Laws, fallible and lyable to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; this Doctrine hath a marvellous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bring the Magiſtrate under great tranſgreſſion, and each Chriſtian under a poſſibility of ſuch bondage, as the Goſpel no where impoſes on him: If a man be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly caſt out of a Church, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate proceeds againſt him, he executes an evil Sentence, and does it blindfold, being by this Doctrine an Officer no way compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, nor in any capacity to make a judgment of the truth or error of it, and ſo cannot poſſibly eſcape a greater ſin. A Chriſtian unduly caſt out of a Church, hath this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt ſuch a proceeding, that Chriſt will never ratifie it upon his Conſcience; but by this manner of execution, he is ſure, whether the Sentence be right or no, to fall under as heavy an outward ſuffering, as the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Sword can inflict upon him. And by this means it will come to paſs, that men ſhall be more dangerouſly concerned in their Lives and Eſtates, by being in the Church, than by being Members of any Society what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>The third Extream in this matter, lies
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62983:25"/> amongſt thoſe, who ſay, <hi>That the Magiſtrate hath nothing at all to do about Religion:</hi> This lies very wide from truth, and cannot in ſuch a general Poſition be made good, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That every man in the World, as he is a Creature? and a Subject to the great God, is bound in his ſtation, and in Gods way, to promote his honour, and endeavour that his Will may be done in the World; it would be ſtrange that the Magiſtrate who is his chief Officer, ſhould be no way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the Laws, which God gives the World, put in execution, by the Perſons, and in the manner he hath appointed it; 'tis not to be imagined, that he that hath the complicated relation of a Chriſtian, and a Magiſtrate to others, ſhould have no care re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to their Spiritual good, 'twere to ſay the Magiſtrate muſt not do that which every man elſe in the World is bound to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> God never ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, truſted any with the care of mens bodies, but he entruſted them likewiſe with ſome care of their Souls: If we look over all the Natural and Moral Relations in the world, ſuch as Parents, Maſters, General of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we ſhall ever find it ſo; Men are to be ruled over as Creatures, that have immortal Souls to be chiefly cared for; and they are to be ruled over as ſuch who have a ſpecial
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62983:26"/> relation to God, and a homage to pay him, above all the reſt of the world; a rule over men without ſome reſpect to this, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate mankind into Brutes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſay the Magiſtrate hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do about Religion, is to deny what hath been practiſed by the Light of Nature before the Law, was practiſed under the Law, ſuitable to that diſpenſation, and both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and commended, and is to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed under the Goſpel, ſuitable to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and is foretold as a bleſſing ſo to be, and in fact hath been ſo ever ſince there hath been a Magiſtrate Chriſtian in the world.</p>
                  <p>Having thus conſidered theſe hurtful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams about the Magiſtrates Power, the laſt thing to come under conſideration, will be the due bounds of a Magiſtrates Power under the Goſpel, that is, <hi>How far a Magiſtrate, being Chriſtian, may improvedly exerciſe his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power for the advantage and benefit of the Goſpel, and wherein he ſtands bounded and obliged not to proceed?</hi> The preſerving a right ſtate whereof, through the torrent of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, will be of ſingular moment to the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen, that the power of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Chriſtian Magiſtrate differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in kind: A Heathen Magiſtrate hath the ſame right, and is bound to do as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62983:26"/> much in Religion as a Chriſtian, only the one having more knowledge of God and his Mind, is bound improvedly to exerciſe his power accordingly: the firſt thing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſtands bound to do for the good of Religion, is to afford the Churches all negative good, that is, to remove all Oppreſſion from them, and all things that do any way hinder them to enjoy the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt; he is to give them reſt, that they may be edified, and walk in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Holy Ghoſt, and lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all godlineſs and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: This, as 'tis a ſpecial bleſſing the Church does not often enjoy, ſo 'tis one chief part of that benefit it receives by Chriſtian Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: And this the Light of Nature will eaſily guide a Magiſtrate to do for any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of the truth of which he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the Affirmative, he is not only to ſee that the Goſpel be preached, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him fully inſtructed in the truths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to unite all Chriſtians, and as much as in him lies, preſerve peace in the Church, to encourage thoſe he finds moſt zealous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſincere in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and by his own example to lead forth his Subjects in all ſound Orthodox Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice: But to comprehend all in one, he is to endeavour in a Goſpel-way to ſee all the Laws of Chriſt put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62983:27"/> and as much as in him lies, ſee his Will done in the World; he is ſo far from being bound to execute, only what the Church will have him, that he is to over-ſee their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and to take care, as Chriſts chief Officer in the World, that all things in the Church be duly, and according to Chriſts appointment adminiſtred. The Apoſtles words are general and full, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers:</hi> Whereſoever the higheſt power is, it muſt needs be ſo, unleſs you will have a higheſt, and a higheſt, which will breed inevitable confuſion; the Civil power bidding a man do one thing, and the Eccleſiaſtical another, it hath ever in fact been ſo; but under the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> where the Emperors were made believe, that 'twas the higheſt piece of Religion, voluntarily to yield up their Power to the Church, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to her direction for the uſe of it, which at firſt they confeſſed was inherent in the Emperors, and not in the Church. Before the Law, not only the Power, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Prieſthood it ſelf, naturally fell into the Magiſtrate: 'Twas ſo in <hi>Noah,</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who was a King and a Prieſt. 'Twas ſo in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Regal and Sacerdotal power were both in him, till they were by God divided between him and <hi>Aaron;</hi> ever ſince which time the exerciſes of Magiſtracy and Miniſtry have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62983:27"/> been, and are to be diſtinct. 'Twas ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt the Heathens; <hi>Homer</hi> tells us of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> that Sacrificed and performed the Worſhip to the gods. In <hi>Rome</hi> 'twas manifeſtly ſo, the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Kings did the like. Since <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> has been diſtinctly exerciſed, ſtill the Inſpection and Regulation of Religion, and the Officers Eccleſiaſtical, have been in the Magiſtrate. Under the Law 'twas plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo. Under the Goſpel, ſo ſoon as there was a <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate</hi> that could exerciſe ſuch a Power, we find it ſo. The right was the ſame in the <hi>Heathen</hi> powers (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily was the ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Appeal unto <hi>Caeſar</hi>) though they could not then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it. There is nothing more plain, than that there may be a Right, where there is not an Ability to exerciſe it. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperors after him, till the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had cheated them into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, took upon them the care and over-ſight of all Religious things, and to ſee all Chriſts Laws executed. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> uſed to call himſelf, <hi>The general Biſhop,</hi> to take care that all things were duly performed in the <hi>Church.</hi> Amongſt our ſelves we reap the Advantage of our Kings and Princes care and concern, in that enjoyment we have of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> This ſhews the great weakneſs on the one hand, of ſuch who ſay,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62983:28"/> 
                     <hi>the Magiſtrate hath nothing to do with Religion;</hi> and the perfect miſtake of thoſe on the other hand, who would have the <hi>Magiſtrate wholly Subordinate to the Church;</hi> and the third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream in thoſe, who would place the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in ſo ſupream a Power, as upon the matter, to do what he pleaſeth;</hi> will be ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated, if we conſider, That as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> is to ſee that executed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed in Religion, ſo he is to bring in nothing of his own; he is punctually tyed up, neither to add nor diminiſh, neither in the matter nor the manner; his buſineſs is to ſee Laws executed, not to make Laws nor change Laws; <hi>Chriſt</hi> has no where grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuch Commiſſion, either to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> or any elſe upon Earth; and therefore we come to a right ſtate of the <hi>Magiſtrates Power,</hi> when we conſider him as Gods chief Officer in the World, directed by the Light of Nature, as well as otherwiſe, to ſee that which God reveals to be his Will, put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: And that which comes particularly to the preſent matter in hand, <hi>That he doth it under the Goſpel in the manner Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:</hi> The manner <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed being as poſitively obliging as the matter; and therefore the Temporal Sword, when 'tis uſed by <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in the concerns of the Goſpel, is the <hi>Dead Fly</hi> that corrupts all their otherwiſe very laudable endeavours.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62983:28"/> Nor need it ſeem ſtrange, that a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould have the care and over-ſight of that wherein he is not to uſe the Temporal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as he is to endeavour to ſee that done by others under the Goſpel, (as the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, and the like) which he is not to do in his own perſon, ſo he is to ſee that done by the Spiritual means <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appointed for it, which he is by no means to force the doing of by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power. He that thinks the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> cannot be uſeful to the <hi>Church</hi> without the Temporal power, may with as good reaſon ſay, That all other powers in the <hi>Church</hi> are uſeleſs, where there is not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Sword to execute them. All Societies of men are under the Regulation of the higheſt power, but yet may act, and ought to do ſo by diſtinct and proper wayes, and by means ſuitable to each. A Colledge of Phyſitians in a State, are under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulament of the higheſt Power, and yet it were very abſurd to force them to give Phyſick, as a thing in it ſelf both unnatural and unreaſonable. The caſe is much more ſo in the Church, nor can any inſtance fully reach it, becauſe the Church is a diſtinct thing of it ſelf, and hath Powers proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it, in which it is ſo compleat, that it can ſubſiſt without the Magiſtrate, as it did in the primitive times. The Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62983:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> Power are things perfectly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſtinct, and ought in their exerciſe to be kept ſo. The higheſt Power governs men, as men, by the temporal Sword, but as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by the ſpiritual, and by ſeeing all things done in Religion by thoſe ſpiritual means Chriſt hath appointed; all which means he may make uſe of, though exerciſed by other hands than his own, and ſtill in a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, as Chriſt's chief Officer in the World, who hath the Charge incumbant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to ſee all that Chriſt hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duely put in execution: But the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf, with the Power proper to him, which is the temporal, is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to act any thing in the Church; what he does is in a collateral way: that were to bring a new Officer into the Church, and a Power new and forreign to execute the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, contrary to the nature, and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the being of it. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> hath wayes, ſuch as Chriſt thought ſufficient, to promote the good of Religion, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the growth of the Goſpel, without drawing the civil Sword, which will make no more impreſſion in ſpiritual concerns than it will do upon a Ghoſt that hath no real body. In the execution of thoſe he ought to acquieſce, but if not content therewith, he will uſe the civil Power to force men to believe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to his Light, and will take
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62983:29"/> Offenders in the Church, and puniſh them by his temporal Power; what is this but to lord it over Gods Heritage, and to make the Goſpel Church, and being a Member of it, a thing of greater, outward, carnal, fear, bondage and ſubjection to men, than ever the Law was? This uſe of the temporal Power is the ſting that wounds all liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and totally overthrows it. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate where I live be an <hi>Arrian,</hi> a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or in any ſuch Error, while he enforceth this but in a Goſpel way, and in Chriſts way of enforcing Truth, only by inſtruction and perſwaſion, this doth not mortally wound me, this does not <hi>Petere jugulum</hi> of my liberty to keep to the Truth; but if he come to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it by the civil Power, and by that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all elſe as Error, my liberty in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaſion is totally gone. The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Magiſtrate to uſe the temporal Power in executing his judgment about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, hurries every man out of the world that is not of his mind; for whatſoever will make a man an Heretick, will bring a man to the Stake; and every Opinion that is not the Magiſtrate's, muſt needs make a man ſo. If Chriſt hath enjoyned the temporal Power to be uſed, it muſt have its utmoſt effect, not only upon Hereticks within, but much more upon thoſe that are Infidels without the Church: If the Magiſtrate be appointed to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62983:30"/> uſe ſuch a power, he muſt not tolerate any thing upon any terms, nor exempt it from the laſh of that power. Where will he find a Rule in the Goſpel to bear with ſome kind of Hereſies, and not with others? He muſt not make ſubmitting to a civil Penalty, to compenſate for an Hereſie, unleſs Chriſt had appointed that as the puniſhment of it; that's a ſelling of ſin, and making a bargain for iniquity, for his own advantage and profit.</p>
                  <p>That therefore which the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel may not do (and without him I am ſure the Church cannot do) in which negative reſtraint upon him, all Liberty of Conſcience is comprehended, and the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Chriſt hath ſo dearly and fully purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compriſed; and which is chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made good by this diſcourſe, ſhall be declared in this following Poſition, which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no Prince nor State ought by force to compel men to any part of the Doctrine, Worſhip or Diſcipline of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proof of which ſhall lie in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis a thing againſt the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo to do; and if the Magiſtrates Power be grounded in the light of nature, then to do a thing againſt that light of nature muſt needs be very <hi>Heterogeneal,</hi> and wholly out of his compaſs; it muſt needs be againſt the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62983:30"/> common Light and Reaſon of mankind, to force me to be believe a thing wholly out of the compaſs of my knowledge and capacity, and which nature reveals not to me. Such are all Goſpel Truths, they are not like the matters of the moral Law, but they are things purely ſupernatural, and of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch things as from the beginning of the world eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor never entred into any mans heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of; theſe things the Apoſtle ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>A man with all the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature diſcerneth not, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. No man can call Jeſus the Chriſt, but by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Will you puniſh a man for not having the holy Ghoſt, that is no way in his power to get, <hi>but is like the Wind that bloweth where and when it liſts?</hi> 'Tis a ſtrange contradiction to our common reaſon, to force men about things wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, and out of their own power. If Force ſhould be uſed at any time, it ſhould be to bring men from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> for without that we cannot be ſaved; but when once Chriſtians, we may be ſaved under different apprehenſions; and yet we may not force a man to be a <hi>Chriſtian, 1ſt,</hi> becauſe 'tis unlawful; and <hi>2dly,</hi> becauſe 'tis impoſſible. 'Tis not lawful, becauſe 'tis not Chriſts way of making Chriſtians, nor a means by him appointed for that purpoſe:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62983:31"/> 
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> 'Tis impoſſible, becauſe force upon men will never beget or change Principles or Opinions. And as we ſhould not force men at the firſt to the Goſpel, becauſe till God reveals it we are wholly ignorant of it, ſo we ſhould not force men that are under the Goſpel to any thing they believe not; for they are as great ſtrangers ſtill to every farther attainment of knowledge in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, till God pleaſe to reveal it, as they were at firſt to the whole; and therefore the Apoſtle calls us to <hi>patience in theſe things one with another, till God pleaſe to reveal himſelf.</hi> The light of nature muſt needs condemn that practice, for another to force me about ſuch things, wherein my own eternal good or ill is only concerned; where it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that I can have any aim but my own Salvation, and can hurt none by my belief but my ſelf. When I have uſed rational ſuitable means to inform another, I ought to acquieſce, it being not a ſuppoſition to be made, that a man would willingly deſign that which he knows will be his own ruin, and which will hurt no body but himſelf. He that forceth me to a Religion, makes me hate it, and makes me think, there wants reaſon, and other evidence to evince it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors compulſion in Religious things, as a ſpiritual rape upon the Conſcience. No man by the light of nature was ever angry
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62983:31"/> with another for not quitting his Conſcience till his judgment was ſuitably informed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man finds it an impoſſibility in himſelf ſo to do. That which ſome ſay, <hi>That though we may not force men to believe, yet men may be forced to the outward means of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> is very little to the purpoſe; for if by outward means, they mean a bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, diſtinct from any Religious Worſhip, no doubt Superiors may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; but if they mean any Religious means, if the means be ſuch as my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not ſatisfied in, I ought not to be forced to it; if it be ſuch as I am ſatisfied in, force is altogether needleſs, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To uſe force in Religion, is wholly unlawful in any hand whatever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis no means appointed by Chriſt to bring about any Goſpel end: For the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to enforce the Laws of the Goſpel by temporal power, or compel men into the Goſpel by ſuch a power, is to act without the leaſt Precept or Preſident, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Engine to execute the Goſpel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> (which is not of this world) and contrary to the nature of all <hi>Goſpel inſtitutions.</hi> The <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> as he ſhould be careful to ſee the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel put in execution; ſo, in the manner, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his wiſdom hath appointed for the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62983:32"/> doing of it, which is by his own Inſtitutions, and his own inviſible power operating and working with them: The great Rule of the Goſpel, is a rule of the Spirit in the hand of Chriſt as Mediator; and 'tis a Rule in the hearts and ſpirits of men; and to ſet up a Rule by any humane power, over any part of the Goſpel, is highly to derogate from that mediatory dominion of Chriſt; nay, to uſe force, is not only to act without, but againſt the declared mind of Chriſt. Does not <hi>Paul</hi> poſitively deliver this, <hi>That the Weapons of the Goſpel are not carnal, but ſpiritual, and mighty through God?</hi> 'Tis not Faggots and Halters, but ſpiritual means, by which men are both to be brought in and caſt out of the <hi>Gospel Church.</hi> 'Tis hearing, and not forcing, by which Faith is wrought. The ſword of the Spirit is the weapon by which Chriſt does all; yea, by which he will deſtroy Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the greateſt Goſpel-enemy the world hath produced.</p>
                  <p>Among all the arguments that are brought to prove the Compulſatory Power of the Magiſtrate under the Goſpel, the greateſt weight is laid upon the Practice of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and what they did under the Law in compelling men to the Worſhip of God then eſtabliſhed. In the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, we ſhall find the truth in hand no way invalidated, and that what was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62983:32"/> then done by the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> cannot reaſonably be made a Rule to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates now under the Goſpel; and that the Analogy will no way hold, may be made appear both from the different ſtation and poſture thoſe Kings were in from all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates now, and alſo from the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church then and now, and many circumſtances peculiarly relating to both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The worſhip and policy of the <hi>Jews</hi> being in it ſelf typical and repreſentive of what was to come hereafter, their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was likewiſe ſo, and in their Kings very eminently; that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Soloman</hi> did very plainly in the type repreſent the Kingly Dominion of Chriſt, none will deny; and 'tis as plain, that the very Throne of <hi>David</hi> it ſelf, upon which the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſate, was likewiſe ſo, there being that Propheſie long before, <hi>That the Scepter ſhould not depart from</hi> Judah <hi>until</hi> Shiloh <hi>came;</hi> and therefore the Power <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after <hi>Solomon,</hi> we find not one concerned for the true Worſhip of God) who were of the lineage of <hi>David,</hi> exerciſed, had a peculiarity in it, that is not applicable to any Magiſtrate now.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God was pleaſed in thoſe times, upon all eminent occaſions of reformation in his Worſhip, and proceedings of that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62983:33"/> nature, to ſend Prophets to declare his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind, and to put an end to all doubts that could be about ſuch things; nay, ſome of the Kings themſelves were Prophets im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired, and did not only take care of the Worſhip eſtabliſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but did themſelves by divine Authority bring in things of a new Inſtitution into the Worſhip of God; this <hi>David</hi> did, and <hi>Solomon,</hi> in bringing Muſick into the Temple, and ſetling the courſes of the Prieſts, and were divinely inſpired to write part of the holy Scriptures. No Magiſtrates now can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch power in themſelves, nor have they any ſuch extraordinary direction to guide them, but are punctualy obliged to whatever Chriſt hath revealed in the Goſpel; and therefore in this reſpect the Analogy no way holds good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> was ſuch, as wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them from all others, ſince that was a Church and a State in the very conſtitution of them mixed together; none could be brought into one, but he was a member of the other; nor could a man be caſt out of the Church, but he was thereby caſt out of the State; to be out-lawed and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was there amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> the ſame thing. <hi>Grotius</hi> expreſſeth it well; <hi>At that time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Wiſdom in Divine and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62983:33"/> Humane Law was not divided;</hi> and he proves it by this, <hi>As the Magiſtrate did intermeddle in Church Affairs, ſo the Prieſt did intermeddle in Cvil things: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Prieſt was a Judge, and did not only give Judgment in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, but in Civil Affairs, being the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the whole Law.</hi> And ſaith the ſame <hi>Grotius</hi> further, <hi>That the Prieſt had Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy.</hi> This alone may be proved in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. <hi>That he is to dye, who obeys not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Prieſt.</hi> 'Tis moſt clear alſo, That <hi>Eli</hi> was chief Prieſt in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and chief Judge in <hi>Shiloe.</hi> 'Tis not any way to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, but that the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power lay then interchangeably mixed; and with as equal reaſon may we bring Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy into the Miniſterial Power of the Goſpel, from what the Prieſts then exerciſed, and their example, as to bring ſuch a power in Religion into the Magiſtrates under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, from the parallel of what thoſe Kings did then. Beſides, the Magiſtratical power was ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church-Policy ſo mixed, that it could not be upheld without it, the very Municipal Law of the Nation was their Religion: He that was chief in the State, muſt needs be Head of the Church. They were a Holy People, living in a Holy Land, appointed to Worſhip in one Holy City, and in one Holy place of that City, and to offer upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62983:34"/> one Altar in that Holy place. The Church of the Goſpel is totally of another nature, perfectly diſtinct from the civil State, can well ſubſiſt without a relation to it, and is no way intermixed in its Concerns with it; And therefore to ſay all Magiſtrates now muſt do as thoſe did that governed ſuch a mixed complicated Church and State in one, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries no proportion at all of reaſon or equity in it, more then if a man ſhould argue from a <hi>Par ratio,</hi> that what <hi>Moſes</hi> did at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> (who was King in <hi>Jeſhuron</hi>) that Kings may now do amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What was then done was by Gods command, and was in a way ſuitable to the frame and ſtate of the Church the <hi>Jews</hi> were imbodied in, and lay chiefly in bringing men from Idolatry to the Worſhip of the true God: (for in differences between Sect and Sect amongſt themſelves, there was nothing that we find, done at any time, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till our Saviours time;) and putting ſuch a kind of Worſhip in execution, as lay in outward carnal Services, and was in every minute particular, exactly ſet down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Firſt, The ſtate of the Goſpel-Church now is wholly differing from what that was, and is ſetled upon clear other grounds and principles. Secondly, Here is no command in the Goſpel for the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62983:34"/> Magiſtrate to do any thing of that nature. Thirdly, Let it be granted as truth, that in parity of reaſon, becauſe Magiſtrates were appointed to take care of Religion then, they are to do ſo ſtill; it muſt of neceſſity be granted alſo, that they muſt do it by the means appointed by Chriſt under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as they did heretofore, by thoſe God appointed under the Law. It is an Inference very infirm, That becauſe the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> compelled men by Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to acknowledge the true God, and forſake Idolatry, therefore Magiſtrates now may not only without, but againſt Chriſts commands, and the whole tenor of the New Teſtament, compel men to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Belief and Worſhip of the Goſpel. The truth is, the civil Power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is no means of Chriſts appointing, for the carrying on of the Goſpel; the Goſpel in the very nature of it, carries an Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in it to all outward force. Inſtead of all the temporal promiſes, and corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the Law, Chriſt makes this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not, ſhall be damned;</hi> That's the Language of the Goſpel; Chriſt ſets Hell and Wrath to come before men, and by his Spirit working upon, and convincing the Conſcience, works more admirable effects upon men that way, than all the outward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62983:35"/> in the World could ever bring about; <hi>The Word of Chriſt is quick and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword; and can divide between the Soul and the Spirit, the Joynts and the Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart.</hi> We have in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> a very perfect account of Gods dealing with men under the Law, and now under the Goſpel, and the plain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the manner of the one and the other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>died without mercy, under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under Foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and done deſpite unto the spirit of Grace?</hi> Here is the higheſt offence imaginable againſt the Goſpel; and the puniſhment, as 'tis clear in the next Verſes, is not Corporal, but Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and to fall into the hands of the living God himſelf to execute it. He that broke <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, fell but into the hand of man, and ſuffered corporal death; but this offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel brings a man to fall into the Hand of God for eternal death. The ſorer puniſhment he ſpeaks of, cannot be outward or corporal, for there can be no ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that kind, than what was inflicted under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, to put a man to death; and therefore he ſpeaks of another puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62983:35"/> in the nature of it. So <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon the place <hi>(Graviori ſupplicio ſcilicet Eterno)</hi> the Supream Puniſhment under the Law was inflicted by <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the Body, ſuitable to that outward ſtate of things; that ſorer Puniſhment for Offences under the Goſpel, according to the nature of it, is inflicted by God himſelf upon the Soul eternally: And ſo the kinds of the Puniſhments under the Law and the Goſpel, ſuitable to the offences relating to each, are here clearly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Scriptures that are uſually urged out of the New Teſtament, to juſtifie compulſion in the Magiſtrate, and corporal puniſhment for ſpiritual offences, are of ſo little cogency, and ſo apparently wreſted from their native ſenſe, that every eye may (if unprejudiced) perceive it. I will inſtance in two or three of thoſe chiefly inſiſted on by Mr <hi>Prinne,</hi> and thoſe who earneſtly contend that way. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias and Saphira were ſtruck to death by</hi> Peter; <hi>therefore corporal Puniſhment is to be inflicted under the Goſpel.</hi> Who is there that does not ſee that whole buſineſs to be miraculous and extraordinary, as the healing the Lame &amp; the Blind was? Firſt, the puniſhment is wholly extraordinary; and ſecondly, the ground of it ſo: For it was upon a Judgment paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on Hypocriſie, and Evil latent in the heart, However, if we will continue that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62983:36"/> Power to any now, we muſt (I hope) derive it to the Church, and not to the Magiſtrate. Another Scripture earneſtly urged, is that of our Saviour; Luke 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> This ſpeech relates to the Parable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is of a noble man going into a far Country, to receive a Kingdom, and to return, and then to take an account of all his Servants, what they had done in his abſence. What can be more clear, than that this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is ſpoken to ſet forth Chriſts aſcenſion into Heaven, and his return to Judgment in the end of the World? And this place is a clear Prophetick expreſſion of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſt will then execute upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The words of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place are very expreſs this way, and indeed, 'tis not poſſible to interpret yet any other: His words are theſe; <q>In this ſecond part he ſeemeth ſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he toucheth all, which in the abſcence of the Maſter do bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to fall away. And Chriſt purpoſed not only to terrifie ſuch with denouncing of horrible Vengeance, but alſo to keep his in faithful obedience; for it is no light temptation to ſee the Kingdom of God ſhaken by the faithleſneſs of many. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we might remain quiet amongſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62983:36"/> ſo many tumultuous ſtirs, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That he will come again, and will be revenged at his coming, of that ungodly falling away.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Scripture preſſed to ſerve for the proof of this, is that wiſh, not command, of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. <hi>I would they were even cut off that trouble you.</hi> This makes as little for the purpoſe as the other: Some amongſt the <hi>Galatians</hi> highly preſſed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip upon them, in Circumciſion and other things; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle beſpeaks them to a Goſpel-puniſhment, in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Language; Caſting-out under the Goſpel, comes in the room of Cutting-off under the Law; the Apoſtle means a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-rejection under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> terms of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-off, which was oppoſitely expreſſed to thoſe that preſſed the obſervance of the Law. So <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place; <hi>Paulus ad pelliculae ſectionem alludit, quam ipſi urgebant.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Poſſumus iſtud de Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſimpliciter intellegere, qualis fuit illa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuoſi Corinthij.</hi> Nothing is more uſual, than to expreſs Goſpel-matters in the Typical Language of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. So the Saints are called Prieſts; their Alms Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; and we are bid to eat the Paſſover. And ſo in that famous place of our Saviour, where he bids us, <hi>If an Offender refuſe to hear the Church, to count him as an Heathen man and a Publican.</hi> 'Tis nothing but a Goſpel-Precept
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62983:37"/> expreſſed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> dialect: Of as little moment, or leſs, if it may be to the purpoſe in hand, are the other Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on. Let the New Teſtament be but fairly dealt with, and ſuffered to enjoy its own native ſenſe, and we ſhall not find a word to countenance the execution of the Laws of the Goſpel by Temporal force, nor to inflict upon any man corporal puniſhment, for a Spiritual offence committed in the Church. Our Saviour directly tells <hi>Pilate</hi> [and <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> calls it a <hi>good confeſſion] That his Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> (he means, no doubt, the Kingdom of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) and therefore his Empire would no way invade <hi>Caeſar's;</hi> though the <hi>Jews</hi> told <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, If he let Chriſt go, he was none of Caeſar's Friend.</hi> His meaning was, That his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as Head of his Church, was a Spiritual Kingdom, diſtinct from the World: and that as God governed the World by the Temporal power, in the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; ſo Chriſt governs his Kingdom by the Power of his Spirit, and by Officers and Inſtitutions wholly different and diſtinct from the World, and ſuitable to ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Nothing ſince Chriſt's Aſcenſion hath more diſturbed the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> or brought more diſorder into Religion, than mixing thoſe two Dominions in their diſtinct powers, that of the World, and this of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62983:37"/> Church together: 'Tis abſolutely neceſſary to keep theſe Powers diſtinct and ſeveral. The Magiſtrate will be moſt uſeful to the Church, by keeping the civil Power in its due bounds; and the Church will be moſt ſafe and ſecure in the uſe of its Spiritual weapons. Let the Sword of Juſtice govern in one, and the Sword of the Spirit in the other, and men will be moſt happy in both.</p>
                  <p>That the Laws made to puniſh Offenders corporally under the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> are not now to be executed without making our ſelves debtors to the whole Law, ſufficiently appears. Take an Inſtance in that Law about putting Idolaters to Death, where, if we conſider the circumſtances attending it, we ſhall find it impoſſible, nay, unlawful now to be executed: Whoſoever tempted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Idolatry, was not to be conceal'd, but the Perſon tempted was obliged to kill him himſelf, whether he were his Brother, Son, Wife, or whatever Relation it were. In the 13th of <hi>Deut.</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thy hand ſhall be firſt upon him, and then the hand of all the People, and they ſhall ſtone him.</hi> And afterwards we find there, whole Cities of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters are to be raced to the ground, and their Children and Cattel utterly deſtroyed. Theſe are Laws that cannot be now executed under the Goſpel; nay, they are forbidden; for we are bid to <hi>walk in Wiſdom to thoſe that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62983:38"/> are without, to do good to all men, and to give no offence, neither to</hi> Jew <hi>nor</hi> Gentile. Nay, Believing Husbands and Wives are bid to live with their Unbelieving Relations, in hopes to convert them. Who can avoid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe Puniſhments, as well as Promiſes were relative to that People, and that ſtate of things, to preſerve them from the reſt of the World, and expired with the diſtinction of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to oppoſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates uſing the civil Power to force Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the Goſpel, Firſt, becauſe 'tis againſt the Light of Nature; And ſecondly, 'tis not only without, but againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Goſpel ſo to do. Famous is that ſaying of <hi>Tertullian</hi> to <hi>Scapula; It appertaineth unto the Authority of the Law of Man and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every man Worſhip as he thinketh good; and one mans Religion doth not hurt nor profit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Neither is it any piece of Religion to inforce Religion; which muſt be undertaken by a mans own accord, and not through Violence.</hi> So thought <hi>Turtullian</hi> antiently. So ſaith <hi>Lactantius, Who ſhall inforce me either to believe what I will not, or not to believe what I will?</hi> So ſaith <hi>Caſsdor, Religion cannot be forced.</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> hath an excellent ſaying to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Faith is to be planted by Perſwaſion, not obtruded by Violence. Bede</hi> tells us, <hi>That here in</hi> England, <hi>ſo ſoon as King</hi> Ethelbert <hi>was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62983:38"/> converted by</hi> Auſtin <hi>the Monk, he made a Law, That none ſhould be compelled to Religion, having underſtood, that Chriſt's Service ought to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and not compelled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Reaſon againſt uſing Force &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion about things under the Goſpel, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis not adequate to the Malady; for if the meaning be to make a man forſake Error, and imbrace the Truth, 'tis no Remedy ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Diſeaſe, nor will it ever reach ſuch a Diſtemper, or effect ſuch a Cure. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe lies in the Soul, and in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the compelling and puniſhing the Body will never help it; the end will be wholly loſt: A man can never be forced to alter or imbrace an Opinion; he may deny it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it: But if he had a deſire, through fear, or other ſlaviſh conſiderations, to do it, yet he cannot, and ſo a man is compelled to an impoſſibility. This uſually makes Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and at laſt Atheiſts, but never makes a right Convert: So the Souls of men this way are endangered, the Devils Intereſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; but neither the Salvation of Souls, nor the Honour of God, by enlarging Truth, any way furthered. He that uſeth no other Medium, but force to me, makes a Lyon and a Maſtiff-Dog as capable of converting me, and giving Laws to my Underſtanding, as he. We are bid to <hi>reſtore Perſons fallen into Error, by a Spirit of Meekneſs, conſidering our ſelves,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62983:39"/> leſt we alſo be tempted.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy; The Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all men, in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give Repentance.</hi> No man ever yet did any good to himſelf or others, by forcing a man againſt the Law of his own Light and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. How many that through fear and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion have gone againſt their Light, have repented openly, to the ſhame and diſgrace of thoſe who violently obtruded Principles upon them, contrary to what was natively and properly their own.</p>
                  <p>Take amongſt many, one famous inſtance, recorded by <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. <hi>The Emperor</hi> Valens, <hi>by threats and menaces to confiſcate and baniſh him, made</hi> Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Cyzicum <hi>turn Arrian, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Decrees of the Council of</hi> Arminium: <hi>The effect of it was,</hi> Eluſius <hi>preſently fell into horror of Conſcience, openly at</hi> Cyzicum <hi>recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had done, crying out of the Emperors unjuſt cruelty, and made all men loath ſuch a proceeding.</hi> A late Author undertakes to juſtifie the uſe of Force in Religion, from the Opinion of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> whoſe Opinion at firſt, as is well known, was, <hi>That it was no way lawful to uſe Force to men of differing Opinions in Religion.</hi> The retraction of that, and the change of his mind was occaſioned by a particular accident at <hi>Hippo;</hi> and it may
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62983:39"/> be, if we conſult all circumſtances, we ſhall find his laſt Opinion had more need of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation than his firſt; and yet at laſt he is very poſitive againſt all capital puniſhment, his words are, <hi>Nullis tamen bonis; 'Tis a thing</hi> ſays he, <hi>that pleaſeth no good man, that any Heretick ſhould be put to death.</hi> We may ſee by this, how men do curtail and enlarge theſe things according to their intereſts and particular affections, and ſet bounds at their own pleaſure; ſome are for one kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſeverity, and ſome for another: and ſo when we leave the Scriptures, that give no direction for any, we loſe our ſelves, and wander as the fancies and intereſts of men lead us. But the Authors words are theſe: <hi>Though Force</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will not remove the Error, yet it may prevent its ſpreading; though it doth not take away the Cauſe, yet it hinders moſt of the miſchievous Effects.</hi> The miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects of an Opinion is conſidered, as it relates to a man himſelf who is poſſeſſed with it, and as it relates to others who may be by him infected with it: Force doth in no wiſe hinder the ſpreading of an Opinion; for if a man be puniſhed for declaring to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what he thinks is right, and he thinks himſelf bound in Conſcience to declare, others are more eaſily taken, and by his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings made more pleaſed with his Notion, and ſooner become his Proſelites. In the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62983:40"/> other caſe, he that forceth me to deny my Opinion, ſins in doing it, but I ſin likewiſe if I comply with him: for ſuch miſchievous effects, as relate to the Perſon himſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an Opinion, hinders them not at all, unleſs you can convert him by it; for it either confirms him in one Error, or leads him into a worſe: If he ſtand it out and ſuffer, he will be the more rooted in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion by it, and be apt to think, want of Arguments brings men to Club-Law: If he comply againſt his Light, he runs then into an apparent and certain evil that way. But the Author proceeds, and tells us, <hi>In a little time it will remove the cauſe of the Error:</hi> That is to ſay, Forcing men, if you do it long enough, will convert them; and the reaſon he gives, is this, <hi>Becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>ranks his Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies amongſt the works of the Fleſh;</hi> and it is not ſeated ſo ſolely in the mind, but that it hath often no ſublimer motives then other ſenſual tranſgreſſions; and as outward conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſometimes the cauſe, ſo they may be the cure of it. That ever any man did change an Opinion, firſt or laſt, by being forced, ſince the World began, is without inſtance, and impoſſible in the nature of the thing to be: One ſays well, <hi>You may as well cure a man of the Cholick by bruſhing his Cout, or fill a mans Belly with a Syllogiſme.</hi> Theſe things do not communicate in matter, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62983:40"/> ſo neither in action or paſſion. But Hereſie is a work of the Fleſh, ſo is every miſtake of the Soul; Hereſie is a work of the Soul rather in miſ-believing than miſ-doing; 'tis a thing in Opinion, rather than Fact. The Apoſtle, in <hi>Galatians</hi> 5. where Hereſie is reckoned amongſt the works of the fleſh, does not put the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between works of the fleſh, as things outwardly acted, oppoſite to what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly believed; but by the fleſh he means the corrupt and carnal mind, oppoſite to the Spirit of God; for he ſays plainly in the Verſe before, <hi>The Fleſh luſts againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh.</hi> By the Fleſh there, he means the corrupt ſtate of man in Soul and Body; ſo that Hereſie may be a work of the fleſh, and yet purely ſeated in the mind: Every corruption in the mind is a work of the fleſh, and yet as 'tis there only, is in ſome ſence a thing ſpiritual and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative. But ſaith he, <hi>Outward conſiderations are ſometimes the cauſe of an Opinion, and may be ſometimes the cure of it.</hi> If outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſuitable to a conviction of my underſtanding, have wrought upon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and made me really believe a thing, there is then no proportion at all of reaſon, to ſay, <hi>That force, becauſe 'tis an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, wholly incapable of working upon my underſtanding, may make me as well disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi> And if thoſe outward conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62983:41"/> he means, have not really convinced me, then 'tis not my Opinion: Either outward conſiderations are the ground of ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or they are not; if they be, they will beſt diſcover themſelves in their effects: ſuch cauſes are beſt ſo known, and only ſo known, and thoſe effects will be obvious, if they be evil, to a due puniſhment; if they be not the cauſe of them, 'tis firſt, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative want of Charity, to make our ſelves evil Judges of other mens hearts, and then an eminent piece of injuſtice to puniſh men upon ſuch a falſe ſuppoſition. He that will take upon him to judge the grounds of any mans Principles which he knows not, may make any Opinion have what Original he pleaſeth. 'Tis a moſt abſurd thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, any man for outward reſpects ſhould ſuffer all reproach and perſecution: You may as well ſay, all the Martyrs ſuffered only to ſet up a Pillar, and get themſelves a Name; 'tis obvious enough to any impartial eye, thoſe outward conſiderations are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to be mens temptations that go another way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> No man under the Goſpel ought to be compel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to believe or practice any thing: [and if not to believe, then not to practice, for the practice ought to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with, and be but the counter-part of the belief; 'tis ſtrangely unreaſonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire uniformity in the practice, where
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62983:41"/> there is variety and difference in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis to bid a man go directly againſt his Light; 'tis miſerable to rend a man into two pieces, his Conſcience in one part, and his outward man and practice in another part: God arreſts him, and draws him in a way ſuitable to his rational Soul one way, and men by means wholly contrary, another: Who, think we, has the greateſt right; and whether is it better to obey God or man in ſuch a caſe? Thoſe that thus impoſe upon men, do what in them lies to ruin them eternally,] I ſay, 'tis not reaſonable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men to believe or practice; (for practice ſhould ſuppoſe belief) becauſe God tells ſo very often, <hi>He only accepts a willing Service in his Worſhip, and abhors all other;</hi> God deteſts the ſmell of a Sacrifice, where the heart is not, where the heart is far from him; and 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be near him, where a man is compelled directly againſt his own judgment. How much does the beauty of the Goſpel lie in this, that Gods People are made by him a willing People, and that God hath his Creature wholly in his Service? Such are the Converts of the Goſpel, where every man is in his rational Soul ſo ſatisfied, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and convinced, that he does all freely: 'Tis a ſevere thing to enjoyn me by penal Laws to worſhip God in a way I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like nor he accepts; which he does not,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62983:42"/> though it be what he has appointed for the matter; if I come not in the manner he has likewiſe appointed to it, I ſhall neither pleaſe him, nor advantage my own Soul. This was the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when God hated their ſolemn Aſſemblies, and ſaid, <hi>Incenſe was an abomination to him.</hi> 'Tis uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe worſhip that needs force; 'twas <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> that upon Politick grounds began to force a Religion, and 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>He made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin, by compelling them to</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel. If men intend to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to God, they muſt not do more for him, than he does for himſelf; he never vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olates the liberty of the rational Soul, but approves things to the underſtanding; if they under this pretext intend to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites to their own power, 'tis very ſinful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The practice of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, poſitively contradicts this courſe; they could have commanded what power they had pleaſed, if that had been the way of ſetling the Goſpel in the world: Chriſt would have no Fire come down from Heaven, but that of the Holy Ghoſt; nor no Sword uſed in the Church, but that of the Spirit; he bids them <hi>Teach all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> that is his way of initiating men into the Church; Not as the <hi>Spainards</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Indians,</hi> who leave them no choice, but to be Baptized or Murthered. Men are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62983:42"/> firſt to be enlightned, and then led into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable practice. <hi>Paul</hi> prays for men, <hi>That the Eyes of their underſtandings might be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> And our Saviour, when he preached, called for <hi>an eye and an ear, to hear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern his Doctrine.</hi> 'Tis no matter for either, where force is the Medium. This deſerves to be very well weighed, that the Apoſtles never urged the Truths of the Goſpel in their infallible Miniſtry of them, upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or other terms than Perſwaſion and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination, and give every man freedom of debate, and counted it a noble thing in the <hi>Bereans,</hi> to examine the Scriptures, <hi>Whether the things they preached were ſo or no.</hi> After all means uſed, every man was left to his own Light. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth he was <hi>not Lord over any mans Faith.</hi> The truth is, that part of the Soul where Faith and Conſcience is ſeated, cannot be reached by any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and therefore force reaching but to outward practice, there can be no other end of it but to make us ſuffer, or elſe practice contrary to what we believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Forcing men to a Religion which is wholly ſupernatural, and impoſing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon them, which are out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Moral Light, as all Goſpel-Principles are, ſuppoſeth a perfect infallibility in the Impoſers, and the thing impoſed, or elſe 'tis ſtrangely unreaſonable; to force men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62983:43"/> againſt their own Light, to be guided by ours, unleſs we are ſure we cannot miſtake, is a ſtrange abſurdity. There is ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for being guided by a miſtake of our own, if it be the beſt light we have; but there is no excuſe for being guided by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of another mans. Three ſorts of men there have been in the world, eminent for Impoſition in Religion, and common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion taught them, that the neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſuch Impoſition muſt be a pretended Infallibility in themſelves &amp; their Doctrines. Such were the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies</hi> of old, who had ſo deluded the People, that <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>thought they were bound to believe what their Rabbies taught, though they ſhould ſay, The Right hand was the Left, and the Left the Right.</hi> Such alſo was <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the <hi>Mufties,</hi> who impoſe all upon the ground of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <hi>Mahomet</hi> at the firſt laying this down as a <hi>Maxim, That there was to be no debate nor diſcourſe of what he preſcribed;</hi> and his <hi>Mufties</hi> ſubdue the People by carrying on the ſame ever ſince. <hi>Grotius</hi> gives a very full account of this in his Book of the <hi>Truth of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> Sect. 3. <hi>Famous for Impoſition are the Popes and Prieſts of the Roman Church, and they with the Hammer of Infallibility beat down all Oppoſition.</hi> That's a refuge never fails to juſtifie things againſt Scripture, Reaſon, and common Senſes of man; That the arrogant
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62983:43"/> aſſumption of Infallibility, ſince the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is nothing elſe but a political Cheat upon the World; God by his Providence, in fact, as well as otherwiſe, hath made it clear to us, ſince thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, have as often contradicted each other, and erred, even in the Opinions each of other, as any People in the World: God in his juſt Judgment leaving thoſe that pretend to be ſo much above all men, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as weak, and as depraved men, as any the world has. But Impoſition, where Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is not pretended nor claimed, muſt needs be but weakly underſet. He that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a Religion upon me, intends I ſhould take his Light inſtead of my own: Impoſing a Religion upon me, ſuppoſeth a duty in me of perfect ſubjection, or elſe 'tis ridiculous, and ſignifies nothing. Admitting a man to uſe his own Light in judging, deſtroys the being of Impoſition in Religion, upon any tolerable grounds of Reaſon; and no body is to be obeyed in whatever they command, but thoſe that are infallible. Whoever it be, the Church or the Magiſtrate, that confeſſeth himſelf fallible, muſt needs admit a poſſibility of miſtake, and ſo gives ground unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to reaſon and conſider what is offered to me; and to what purpoſe will that be, but farther to enſnare me, if I muſt neceſſarily obey? and unleſs I diſcover the weakneſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62983:44"/> and miſtake of what is put upon me, I may refuſe it.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> where Infallibility is not claimed, and this Doctrine taught, <hi>That if any man command any thing ſinful</hi> [of which every mans Conſcience is likewiſe acknowledged the Judge] <hi>we are to ſuffer paſſively, and not obey actively.</hi> There can be no other ſucceſs of Impoſition, but to make me ſuffer for being an honeſt man, and following the Light of my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for if the thing enforced be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my own judgment, forcing me to it is needleſs; if it be not, I am bound by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, acknowledged by all, not to obey, and ſo the event muſt needs be my ſuffering in performing my Duty. Nay, ſuppoſe further, that the thing enjoyned be Infallible in its own nature, and the Perſon enjoyning it be ſo in that very act, yet till I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in my reaſon of both thoſe, they are to me as if they were not ſo, and I ſhall never upon that account yield implicit obedience; and when I am convinced of ſuch an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, my own Reaſon, without any other motive, forceth me into ſubjection, as that which is beſt for me. No man can or ought to command me to alter my Judgment and Conſcience, guided by the beſt Light I have, till he can ſhew me, that as I am fallible, ſo he is infallible, and that he is ſo in that act of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62983:44"/> impoſing a Religion upon me, my own light is more ſafe to me than any other mans, that is not ſo intruſted, and is but equally fallible with my ſelf, though in knowledge never ſo far above me. He that owns, he may be miſtaken as well as I, and yet would have me obey what he commands, againſt what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, would at the ſame time make me both a ſinner and a fool; a ſinner to God, and a fool to my own Reaſon; a ſinner to depart from my own Conſcience, by which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects I ſhould be guided, and by which I ſhall hereafter be judged; and a fool to eat by another mans taſte, and to part with my own Reaſon, without any aſſurance of being guided by a better. A Magiſtrate impoſeth Uniformity in Religion, acknowledgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not infallible, but that he may be under miſtakes, acknowledgeth likewiſe, that no man is bound to obey him actually in any thing ſinful; acknowledgeth that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is ſinful, lies in every mans own Conſcience, as to his particular actings, and that every mans Conſcience, though errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is to be followed till better informed. Take the coherence of theſe things, which are all granted Truths amongſt us, and the reſult will be twofold; 1st, That a man that cannot in Conſcience conform to ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Uniformity, as thinking it ſinful, is puniſhed for doing what is acknowledged to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62983:45"/> be his duty. 2dly, there can never be any other end in forcing Uniformity, where ſuch Principles are taken for granted, but to bring ſuch men into ſuffering, who reſolve to keep their Integrity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Every man in the World is to be a Judge for himſelf in all matters of the Goſpel Religion, and ſo ought not to be forced to believe or practiſe any thing he is not convinced of. To what end is preaching or diſcourſing to men, but that they may judge of what is ſaid? A man being obliged to anſwer for himſelf, he muſt needs be ſo to judge for himſelf. And this Foundation once laid, upon which many of our moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragible Arguments againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are built, all pretenſions of impoſing upon men, contrary to their own Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, will with apparent reaſon fall to the ground: For if I ſtand obliged to God, as a creature by him enabled and fitted ſo to do, to make a Judgment within my ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of Light I have, of all things I believe or practiſe in Religion, then I can never come under an obligation to obey any Commands that compel me againſt my Light, nor ever to follow the Judgments of others, farther than I am convinced by it, and it becomes my own. Now to make this evident, that every man under the Goſpel is bound at laſt to judge for himſelf, in all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62983:45"/> things relating to God and his own Soul, let theſe things following be conſidered:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Every Perſon in the World is under a Scripture-command, <hi>To prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good;</hi> Whatever comes from Miniſters by way of inſtruction, or from Magiſtrates by way of command, 'tis a duty to give a due reſpect to it, and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to way it, and at laſt, by the beſt Light we have, to make a judgment of it, and ſettle the Conſcience about it; but no way are we bound to follow blindfold, whether we like it or not: To prove and examine, ſhows a neceſſary uſe of Reaſon, and an act of the Underſtanding, in weighing and pondering, and to hold faſt in chooſing and determining. We are bid, <hi>To obey God, rather than Man:</hi> That Command can never be put in practice, but by judging what is of God, and what is of Man; and it muſt neceſſarily refer to a judgment of our own; for all mens pretence is, that what they enjoyn is of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every man is bound to do, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he does in Religion, in Faith; for that the rule is poſitive, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin; he that doubts is damned if be eat:</hi> To do an action in Faith, is to do it upon a judgment made within himſelf, that what I do, is that I ought to do, and that I perform my duty therein. And herein I muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be my own judge, no other mans Faith
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62983:46"/> can ſo ſerve my turn, as to excuſe me from ſin: If any thing be commanded me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my own judgment, I can never obey it in Faith, and ſo never obey it without Sin. The ground of all Faith lies in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and ſatisfaction of the Judgment; without the concurrence of that, no action in Religion can ever be done in Faith, and ſo never be done as it ought to be done. And therefore it is that the Apoſtle pronounced him <hi>happy, that condemneth not himſelf in the thing that he alloweth.</hi> A man through an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Judgment may do a thing in Faith, and yet do it ſinfully: his Faith will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; but yet he is bound to exerciſe Faith in every thing he does. He that doth any thing without Faith, ſins in it: he that doth an ill action in Faith, hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for it; thereby <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto;</hi> ſo that in the one, Faith leſſens the ſin of the action, and in the other, makes it compleatly good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Every man muſt needs be a Judge for himſelf, becauſe God will accept or not accept, and deal with him here and hereafter, according to what his own judgment was, and his ſuitable conforming himſelf thereto. For this we have a plain Scripture; <hi>Every man ſhall give an account of himſelf to God:</hi> Every mans Underſtanding is his Talent, God expects he ſhould imploy it, and not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62983:46"/> hide it, and accordingly deals with men; <hi>Where much is given, much is required; and where little is given, little is required.</hi> Whence comes the ſatisfaction of Conſcience in this World, but that while we walk ſincerely according to our Light, we reſt ſatisfied of an acceptance with God, and we find accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, God accepteth ſuch, and abhors an Hypocrite. That God will hereafter judge men according to the knowledge they have, and the Judgment they make within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Scripture is every where clear: <hi>He that knows his Maſters will, and doth it not, he ſhall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> God will judge men out of their own Mouthes, and out of their own Breaſts; if then God deals with men here, and judges them hereafter according to the Light they have, 'tis that ſure that ſhould be the Rule of our living. To ſay, I did what others bid me, and never judged within my ſelf what God required from me, nay, when I was convinced, he required the contrary from me, will be but a poor excuſe, when mens Conſciences ſhall come upon the Stage to do the Office of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing or accuſing in that great day. Our Divines ſay very right, when they tell us, <hi>Every mans Light is to be his Guide:</hi> If it be falſe and erronious, he lies under ſin, becauſe 'tis his duty to be better informed; but till
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62983:47"/> he is ſo, 'tis his duty to puruſe that light he has, as the leſſer evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To ſay a man is not to judge for himſelf, is to unman him, and change him from a rational Creature to a Bruit: What has God lighted ſuch a Candle in man (as <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi>) for, but to judge and diſcern by, and be a guide to him? God that has given a man an ability to judge, does he ever forbid, nay, does he not always enjoyn the uſe of it that way? Beſides, 'tis impoſſible that a man (ſuppoſing him a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature) ſhould conſent any thing without paſſing firſt an act of his Judgment upon it. He that yields up himſelf to the Infallibility of <hi>Rome,</hi> paſſes a Judgment firſt, that 'tis beſt to do ſo; and therefore when men are perſwaded to joyn themſelves in the Roman Church, and truſt wholly to that, in believing whatever the Church believes, they are firſt admitted to judge, that 'tis beſt to do ſo; and are made firſt Judges for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, before they reſign up their Judgment to others; to what end elſe were all Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Reaſoning about ſuch matters? The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> while they profeſs againſt this private judgment as a deteſtable thing, <hi>that every man ſhould be a Judge for himſelf,</hi> they cannot deny, but that every man is actually ſo; and therfore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> flies to this ſorty ſhift, he ſays, <hi>Before men are in the Church,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62983:47"/> they muſt judge for themſelves, but when they are once in the Church, they muſt reſign themſelves to her Infallibility.</hi> The Engliſh of which is, <hi>That before a man is a</hi> Romaniſt, <hi>he may uſe his Reaſon, but after muſt be led and driven like a Bruit.</hi> And the truth is, a Church conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an implicit Belief, under an impoſed Infallibility, differs little from a dumb Herd of Cattel. Either in ſuch a caſe I make uſe of my Reaſon, or I do not; if I do not, I ceaſe to be a man under the denomination of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature; if I do, I muſt neceſſarily be a Judge for my ſelf; for if I am guided by another judgment than my own, as that I think beſt for me, there is as clear an act of my judgment in ſo doing, as if I were punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually directed by my own.</p>
                  <p>This we call <hi>knowledge</hi> in men, God hath given to taſte Principles and Notions, as the Mouth taſteth Meats; take away once the uſe of this taſte, and you take away the nobleſt accompliſhment of a man: You make a man, created in honour, if he do not underſtand, like a Beaſt that periſheth; as the Eye guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Body, ſo the judgment of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding guides the Soul; force a man once from the uſe of this, and you betray him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dark Chaos of ſlavery and bruitiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and render him an object fit for the ſame ſcorn and contempt that <hi>Sampſon</hi> found when he had loſt his two Eyes. By theſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62983:48"/> things we may plainly diſcern, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of every mans being a Judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in divine things, is grounded both upon Scripture and Reaſon; and that 'tis not only lawful, but a poſitive duty, God expects the performance of, and obliges every man living to. And this being ſo, for any Power on Earth to compel men to believe or practiſe contrary to their Judgment and Conſcience, muſt needs be both unlawful and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ill ſucceſs Force and Impoſition in Religion hath ever had, and which it hath a neceſſary tendency to have, may very well make us out of love with it; there can poſſibly be no other effect of it, but either to debauch men in their Conſciences, or bring violent Perſecutions upon their Perſons and Eſtates. If the firſt, thoſe that impoſe, bring a guilt upon themſelves, and partake of the ſin, as being the great occaſion and cauſers of it: So did <hi>Jeroboam</hi> when he made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, the guilt ſtuck to himſelf, as well as to the People. If the ſecond, men are ſufferers from men, for doing their duty to God, and part with their Eſtates, becauſe they cannot with their Integrity; and in this caſe the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment falls upon the Sufferers, but the Guilt ſtill upon the Impoſer. Either a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, impoſing in Religion, is to be obey'd in whatſoever he commands, or not;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62983:48"/> if he be, we ſhall then excuſe thoſe that obey'd <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and caſt reproach upon all the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that have ſuffered for refuſing the ſinful commands of Superiors. If they be not, there muſt be then ſome judgment when they are to be obey'd, and when not; and that can be no other than every mans own Conſcience: And if every mans own Conſcience, and the light of it is to be his Rule, by which he is to judge, then when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I refuſe to obey a command in Religion, becauſe my Conſcience tells me, <hi>'tis ſinful,</hi> I am plainly puniſhed for doing my Duty, and following that Light God hath given to guide me. Nay, ſuppoſe my Conſcience be erroneous, 'tis confeſſed by all, 'tis a ſin not to follow it till better informed; and if ſo, I am ſure 'tis likewiſe a ſin to force me out of it. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia quamvis errans ſemper ligat ita ut ille peccat qui agit contra Conſcientiam quoniam agit contra voluntatem Dei quamvis non materialiter &amp; vere tamen formaliter &amp; interpretive,</hi> Ameſ. de caſ. Con. If we look upon this practice in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> where 'tis in its Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, what a Maſſacre of Souls hath it made? What Darkneſs and miſerable Ignorance is grown up in the Laity by it? And amongſt the Clergy, what Pride, Corruption and Tyranny? Where it has been practiſed in the Reformed Churches, it has introduced nothing but Diviſions and Animoſities, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62983:49"/> the ſad effects of them; thoſe who have been freed from the <hi>Roman Impoſition,</hi> and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the <hi>Proteſtant Truths,</hi> being leſs able to endure Impoſition than any; being by their departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> furniſhed with Principles that do wholly overthrow any ſuch Power, by whomſoever exerciſed. How little hurt would variety of <hi>Opinions</hi> about Religion do in the World, if it were not for this? What hurt could any mans Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion do me, if he uſed no other Weapons than <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe?</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> Opinions makes them pernicious and troubleſom to the World, and makes every Party ſtrive to get the Magiſtrate on their ſide that they may ſuppreſs the reſt, and turn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into a worldly Intereſt. Religion troubles no body as Chriſt left it, but as men make it. By this practice, men of differing judgments in Religion can never live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the World, nor enjoy the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they might afford one to another in civil concerns, and in Religion too, ſo far as they agree, becauſe their Conſciences will not let them come up to the practice of an impoſed Uniformity in all things. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this were the thoughts of <hi>Paul?</hi> he bids us <hi>joyn together, ſo far as we agree; and in other matters wherein we do not agree, to wait till God ſhall reveal himſelf to us.</hi> What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing is it, to oblige Chriſtians
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62983:49"/> either to ſuffer, or follow all the changes made by human Powers in Religion, upon what worldly or political ends ſoever, to have the Conſcience floating about at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates pleaſure, as his property, which is only God's peculiar? Thoſe that lived in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, Q. <hi>Mary</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had occaſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to experience this, who muſt either have withſtood a conformable practice with ſuffering, or elſe ſurely have been ſometimes out of the way.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſhould put us perfectly out of all charity with the uſe of Force in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is, when we conſider, the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel can never be eſtabliſhed by it. You may eſtabliſh a falſe Worſhip, or a formal outſide Worſhip, but never make ſuch Worſhippers as Chriſt ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>The true Worſhippers under the Goſpel are ſuch who Worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> You may eſtabliſh a falſe Worſhip, that is, a Worſhip of mens appointing; for if they be but outwardly obey'd in what they inſtitute, they look no farther. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s buſineſs was to keep the People from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> if they came but to <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> he cared for no more; he little minded the Religion he had ſet up, for he made Prieſts of the meaneſt of the People; his end was Political, to bring men into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62983:50"/> to himſelf. You may alſo eſtabliſh a formal Worſhip, you may by force make men hypocritically conform to the out-ſide of true Worſhip; you may force men to the Sacraments, but without they be qualified with thoſe Praerequiſites God requires, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of performing an acceptable Service, you force them to commit a great Sin.</p>
                  <p>That you cannot by force eſtabliſh the right Goſpel-Worſhip, appears by theſe two things: 1ſt, 'Tis a <hi>ſpiritual Worſhip;</hi> and 2dly, 'Tis a <hi>voluntary Worſhip. Firſt,</hi> 'Tis a Spiritual Worſhip; there is no one part of Goſpel Worſhip lies in the bear outward performance of any duty: <hi>The Word</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul) did not profit, becauſe 'twas not mixed with Faith.</hi> In hearing, praying, receiving Sacraments, and all others, there is more required than the bare outward act, 'tis Faith in theſe things, and that which is Spiritual in them, that gives them an acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and that men cannot be forced into: you can never compel into that which is purely Spiritual. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Worſhip; the Goſpel is a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to <hi>every one that willeth, to eat and drink of the Bread and Water of Life.</hi> 'Tis the very evidence of Chriſt's Power under the Goſpel, <hi>That his People are made a willing People;</hi> and therefore the Service of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel cannot be forced: 'Tis a contradiction
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62983:50"/> to ſay, <hi>That may be well done by Compulſion, that ought to be freely and voluntarily done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things are with great vehemency oppoſed to this, and which do indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the greateſt ſhew of Reaſon for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion in Religion, of all the Arguments brought for it. 1ſt, 'tis ſaid, <hi>That compelling men to the outward means of Religion, is a way God often uſeth to work inward Converſion.</hi> 2dly, <hi>That though it do not ſo work, yet a bear outward compliance is acceptable to God, and bleſſed by him.</hi> And for this the example of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s humiliation, and the <hi>Ninevites</hi> Faſt is brought.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſay, That ſomethings under the Goſpel are as well Moral as Religious, and have a foundation in the light of nature, as well as in the inſtitution of the Goſpel; and to theſe, men may be commanded by the Magiſtrate. As Hearing is an act purely moral, as well as divine, a man may be injoyn'd to hear the Goſpel preached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being forced to give his aſſent to it. The Light of nature guides the Magiſtrate to inſtruct his Subjects in whatever he thinks for their eternal good; and the light of nature obligeth every man to hearken to every providential Inſtruction God affordeth, and improve it for his good. A man that is only commanded to hear and receive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is dealt with as a rational Creature,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62983:51"/> and forced to nothing; the judgment is ſtill left in himſelf. A man may hear, and be no way concluded; hearing is in order to choice and determination. But ſuch things as are purely of a Goſpel inſtitution, and are perfectly ſupernatural; to theſe, men may not be any way compelled, nor can we ever expect a bleſſing upon it; Firſt, Becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and not compulſion, is the way Chriſt hath appointed to bring men, and fit them to partake of all Goſpel-Ordinances. Secondly, Becauſe a man joyning himſelf to the Goſpel, and partaking in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Worſhip of it, upon no other ground but compulſion, and is in his heart all the while either ignorant of it, or againſt it, ſins in all he does; and therefore though God can over-rule the ſins of men to good ends, yet muſt not we do evil that good may come of it, nor anticipate Converts to the Goſpel by undue means. God can work mens converſion by any means, or without means, but yet we are bound to ſeek mens converſion by ſuch means as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that end, and left us under an obligation to proſecute.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Prynn,</hi> who is earneſt for compulſion and corporal puniſhment under the Goſpel, when he is told, <hi>That it is not a way to make Converts, and to work upon the underſtanding;</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62983:51"/> Replies, <hi>That corporal ſufferings, afflictions and preſſures upon the outward man, are an uſual means of Gods ſanctifying and ſaving men.</hi> 'Tis true, a means that he over-rules, and a means he reſerves in his own hand, to uſe as he pleaſeth, but no means appointed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel for us to uſe, and ſo we cannot expect the concurrence of Gods operation, which can only make it effectual upon it. Becauſe God many times ſanctifies the pain and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens Bodies, and the ſufferings and loſſes in their Eſtates and Reputations, to the ſaving of their Souls, we may not (I hope) bring theſe things upon men for that end, becauſe they are not means God hath intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with the uſe of; nor has indeed any outward force upon the body a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in it ſelf to alter a mans mind, but rather the contrary; but God by his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it, can over-rule it that way; and unleſs it be by him a means appointed, that ſo we may expect ſuch an operation, 'tis both unlawful and unreaſonable to make uſe of it. In ſhort; if by compelling men to outward means, be meant, only to compel a man to a bare outward moral action, and ſuch are all things relating to inſtruction, men may be commanded to it: If by means be meant, a Religious Goſpel means of Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and purely relating to the Goſpel, ſuch as the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the like, no man ought
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62983:52"/> to be compelled to them, nor can we expect any good from ſuch a Compulſion, farther then as God is pleaſed to bring good out of evil.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, <hi>That though compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do not work real Converſion, yet an outward conformity, though there be nothing elſe, is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God:</hi> That is, That to compel a man by force to profeſs he believes that which he no way believes, and to practice that which he no way likes, is a Reformation God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of, this I utterly deny; unleſs it can be made appear, that God is pleaſed with Hypocriſie, accepts the outward Man, where the heart and the inward Man is far from him, and has no better means to bring men into the Church, than unreaſonable compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which muſt needs beget an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Service. As ſuch a Conformity can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſe God in the perſons conforming, ſo neither in the perſons impoſing. Not in the perſons conforming, becauſe they do it not from a right Principle, nor to a right end, they do it either without knowledge ignorantly, or againſt knowledge unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Beſides, he that comes to partake of any Goſpel-Ordinance in an undue manner [which he muſt needs do, that comes only by compulſion] ſins in the very act: He that receives the Sacrament without a due quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſins in the very act; and therefore
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62983:52"/> ſuch Conformity may ſatisfie men, but can never pleaſe God. Not in the perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, becauſe they do not execute any Law of Chriſts in ſo doing, and therefore it will be ſaid, <hi>Who required this at your hands?</hi> The forcing an outward Reformation in manners is quite of another nature, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may and ought to do, and is a thing highly pleaſing to God, a thing taught by the Light of Nature, commanded by God ſo to be, and a thing that is well done, both in thoſe that command, and thoſe that obey; when the bare outward act of evil is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forborn, and the contrary command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed. The forcing men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from the practice of groſs evil and wickedneſs, though they do it in Hypocriſie, has a wide difference from the forcing men to perform Goſpel-Duties in Hypocriſie. Moral Actions are poſitively good and evil in their own nature; Goſpel-Duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed are only ſo, as they are circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. And therefore the two Inſtances of <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites</hi> will no way fit this matter: What was done by the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> for ought appears, was well done, with all the circumſtances that ſhould make it to be ſo; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>They repented at the Preaching of</hi> Jonah.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Ahab</hi> did, will be clearly differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in two things; Firſt, it was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62983:53"/> action; And Secondly, it was only a Moral action. 'Twas voluntary, for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the dictates of his own Conſcience, upon what the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid to him. And Secondly, it was purely a Moral act, his Humiliation was no other; He himſelf was an Hypocrite, and his Service was hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and abominable in the ſight of God; yet the outward act of his Humiliation was in it ſelf good, and God rewards it with an outward bleſſing. That men may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled about actions Morally good and evil, is out of doubt, and that God does likewiſe with outward bleſſings and judgments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſh Moral good and evil, is alſo plain. But herein lies the difference of force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in things Moral and things Divine: In things Moral, the action in it ſelf, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever circumſtantiated, is poſitively good or evil. Things of Divine Inſtitution are quite otherwiſe; there the manner of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance makes the action good or evil. He that ſacrificeth an Ox, is as if he killed a man; he that killeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs neck: Where the manner of performing the command is not obſerved, as well as the bare outward act of performance. And ſo in all Goſpel Duties, the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, as Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, and the reſt, the actions themſelves in thoſe things are not ſimply good; nay, they are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62983:53"/> accidentally evil, unleſs they have all the due circumſtances attending them; the goodneſs of thoſe things depends wholly upon Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and there the manner, as well as the matter, muſt be punctually obſerved. Nay, the manner of doing ſuch things determines the matter of them; for if they be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their due manner, the Action is good; if not, the Action it ſelf is ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far endeavoured to eſtabliſh this Truth, That the exerciſe of force by the hand of the civil Power, is ho means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt, either for ſetling or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Churches of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is a thing in its own nature alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unreaſonable ſo to be; And that Princes and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel ſhould imploy their care, to ſee the Laws of Chriſt's Kingdom put in execution, in the way and manner he himſelf hath appointed, and ought to reſt themſelves ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as that which his infinite Wiſdom hath provided, and to leave things that are purely Goſpel-offences to Goſpel-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as moſt adaequate and proper; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that if after ſuch puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, Errors and Hereſies ſhall continue in the Church, Chriſt will over-rule the Being of them for holy ends and purpoſes, acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Paul, There muſt be Hereſies,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62983:54"/> that thoſe that are approved may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt;</hi> which though it be no good ground to indulge Hereſie, from any puniſhment Chriſt hath appointed for it, yet 'tis a very good ground to ſatisfie our ſelves upon, after all Chriſts means uſed, and to ſtop us from all violent and irregular proceedings, when we conſider, <hi>That Chriſt will extract good out of ſuch evil, and turn ſuch things to his own Glory, and the good of ſuch as are ſincere.</hi> I ſay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving endeavoured the proof of theſe things, that the plaineſt Truths of the Goſpel ought not to be enforced upon men, much leſs thoſe more doubtful and obſcure, concerning Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Order [of the obſcurity of which there needs no other evidence, than that the holieſt, wiſeſt, and moſt impartial men have in all Ages differed about them.] How may we lament over the preſent Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Ceremonies, now enjoyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in <hi>England,</hi> which are no part of Divine Truth, nor any of Chriſts Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but things perfectly Humane in their creation, and yet are enforced by the civil Power upon the practice and Conſciences of men. If Chriſt did not appoint his own Laws to be inforced upon the Church, but to be received and executed by the influence and operating power of the Holy Ghoſt, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them; How little pleaſed will he be to have Laws and Rules made by others,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62983:54"/> to be ſo inforced? If it be neither reaſonable nor warrantable for a Magiſtrate to inforce the Truths of the Goſpel in his own ſenſe of them, How much leſs is it ſo to enjoyn things in the Worſhip of God, wholly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by men, and of their deviſing? Thoſe, as being Divine, are in their own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and certainly true. Theſe as being Humane, are lyable to all Error and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. How unmerciful a thing is it, and how unlike the Primitive Chriſtians, to make ſuch Ceremonies a Rule of the Churches Communion, which uſed to be nothing but the Creed? That a man now only out of Conſcience to God, and without a juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of either Faction or Folly, or any other deſigned end, may very well become a <hi>Non-Conformiſt</hi> to theſe preſent impoſed Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, hath been often evinced.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things may afford us ſome proſpect into thoſe grounds upon which Liberty of Conſcience ought to be aſſerted, and alſo the due and natural bounds of it. When men diſcourſing of this Subject, are enumerating what parties may be tolerated, and what not. What Fundamentals are neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make a man a capable Subject of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and how far the puniſhment is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon men for matters of this Nature, are to proceed, and where to be terminated; they do but loſe themſelves, and come to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62983:55"/> involved with inextricable inconveniences, and do uſually little more then diſcover their own particular inclinations and intereſts; and at laſt often end in this Determination, <hi>That none are fit to be Indulged, but ſuch as are punctually of their own belief and perſwaſion.</hi> The general Laws of Nature, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Laws of the Goſpel, are the beſt Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in this Caſe: As the firſt renders it a thing unreaſonable, ſo the other makes it unlawful to tolerate any thing upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the common Light, and the common Intereſt and natural good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And ſo on the other hand, 'tis equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as unreaſonable and as unlawful, to force men about things wholly Supernatural and purely Spiritual; and ſo are all the matters of the Goſpel, which lie ſeated in mens Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Perſwaſion, in reference to their own Eternal Condition: and as they have no proper relation to Humane Concerns, ſo they are in <hi>Aliena republica,</hi> and are only cognizable there, and only to be dealt with by ſuch Spiritual means and puniſhments, as Chriſt in the Goſpel hath appointed for that end.</p>

                  <head>LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE <hi>The Magiſtrates Intereſt:</hi> Or, To grant <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to Perſons of <hi>Different Perſwaſions</hi> in matters of Religion, is the <hi>Great Intereſt</hi> Of all Kingdoms and States, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of <hi>ENGLAND. <hi>Aſſerted and Proved.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HAving thus far conſidered thoſe things, which do moſt immediately reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Magiſtrates Duty, in allowing a due Liberty to each mans Conſcience, We will in the next place conſider how far his Intereſt engages him this way. That 'tis the great Intereſt of all Proteſtant States, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of <hi>England,</hi> To give Liberty to men of differing Apprehenſions in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is evident, if we conſider, That a Prince or State, by impoſing the Principles of any one party in Religion, makes himſelf of that party, and engages all the reſt againſt him. 'Tis no way prudent for a <hi>Prince,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62983:57"/> when his Subjects conſiſt of many differing Judgments, to reſolve to have them all of one mind, (a thing impracticable) or elſe to be their declared Enemy and Perſecutor; 'tis a ready way to interrupt his own quiet and repoſe, without any other effect: for he will never by force and violence unite them in one Opinion, thoſe differences will rather be fomented, and all Animoſities ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereupon, and men rather fixed and confirmed by ſuch Perſecution, than any way removed from their Principles by it. 'Tis not the having ſeveral parties in Religion under a State, that is in it ſelf dangerous, but 'tis the perſecuting of them that makes them ſo. Firſt, It puts them all under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and then unites them together in ſuch diſcontent; <hi>Thuanus,</hi> a wiſe States-man, ſaith, <hi>Heretici, qui pace datâ factioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus franguntur, perſecutione uniuntur contra Rem Publicam.</hi> Thoſe who in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples largely differ from each other, when they come to be all bound up together in one common Volumn, and linked in the ſame chain of Perſecution and ſuffering, will be ſure to twiſt themſelves into an united Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to ſuch an undiſtinguiſhing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Whereas the thing in it ſelf rightly conſidered, ſo many divided Intereſts and Parties in Religion are much leſs dangerous than any, and may be prudently managed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62983:57"/> to ballance each other, and to become gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more ſafe and uſeful to a State, than any united party or intereſt whatever. He that is ſuffered to enjoy, under a State, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Religion, when differing from the publick Profeſſion, has not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tye of a Subject upon him, for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection as a man, but the cumulative obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thanks to pay for his Indulgence as a Chriſtian under ſuch a Character. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in ſuch a poſture, as they will ever be ſtudious of an opportunity to teſtifie their grateful fidelity, and by ſome eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to lay up a ſtock or Merit, that may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their future quiet; ſo they will be, of any, moſt careful not to forfeit ſo pleaſing an Indulgence, by falling under a publick diſpleaſure. A Prince in ſuch a ſtate of things, by making himſelf a common Father to the whole Proteſtant Religion, though made up of ſome differences within it ſelf, will be ſecured not only of that common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Obedience and Subjection, but with it, that more noble, of the Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of all his Proteſtant Subjects. To ſay any party in Religion is diſaffected to a State, and therefore not fit for ſuch favour, when ſuch diſaffection, if it be, does plainly ariſe from the Severity of the State againſt them, in that caſe; the reaſon why favour ſhould not be ſhewed, is removed by ſhowing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62983:58"/> of it: For, as perſecuting men for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, muſt neceſſarily diſguſt them; ſo giving them the freedom of it muſt needs equally oblige them. 'Tis no true meaſure to take of any parties in Religion, to ſay the one are better Subjects than the other, when the one are favoured and countenanced, and the other ſtill kept under and oppreſſed: There is no reaſon, but to believe there is an equal Tendency in all to love that Prince or State, where they find favour and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 'tis a common diſpoſition runs in the blood of all men; and by how much the Principles of any party are leſs taking and plauſible, the leſs dangerous ſtill is that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as they will need favour more than others, ſo they muſt needs lie proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſecured to a State, by the Obligation is put upon them.</p>
                  <p>Take it for Truth, which is commonly affirmed, <hi>That all ſuch for whom Liberty is at any time deſired, are men full of Faction and full of Error:</hi> For the firſt, 'tis certain, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> will not only continue, but foment ſuch Faction, and give it a plauſible pretence to juſtifie it ſelf upon; whereas a Liberty granted in matters of Conſcience, will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly win ſuch men to a due and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Obedience, as finding themſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they cannot expect to mend, or elſe will lay them open to ſuch apparent juſtice
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62983:58"/> for puniſhment, and bring them under ſuch a general contempt, as ſhall leave them ſtript of all pretenſions, and render them wholly inconſiderable. 'Tis marvellous prudence to ſeparate between <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> which can never be, but by a Liberty of the one, that ſo they may diſtinctly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the other: He that hath liberty granted to worſhip God according to his Conſcience, and yet is not ſatisfied, but continues trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, makes every body ready to be his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, and makes that diſcovery, which could never have been made before; that Faction was his end, and Conſcience but the pretended means; ſuch men will not only lie open to the States juſt ſeverity, but to the hatred of all men who do generally diſlike ill actions moſt, when they come from men of the beſt pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>Puniſh men for their Religion, becauſe you judge them Factious, and mix all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you fall into this double Error; Either you puniſh men for Faction that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it not, and ſo, beſides a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, do what you can to make thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who are not, nor would not be ſo; or elſe thoſe that are ſo, you give them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conſcience to juſtifie themſelves in whatever ſufferings comes upon them. When people differing from the publick Religion meet to worſhip God, and are ſeized and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62983:59"/> puniſhed for ſo doing, the Magiſtrate ſaith, <hi>He puniſheth for Faction;</hi> they ſay, <hi>They ſuffer for Religion.</hi> And all People who ſee the actual puniſhment inflicted, for things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Conſcience and Religion, will be ſure to believe and pitty them, and be ready to condemn the State. A due Separation, as 'tis beſt to be made, ſo 'twill only by a Liberty given, be obtained. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends nothing but to give God the Homage of his Conſcience, will have freedom to do it; and he that under that has other ends and aims, will be juſtly puniſhed for it: But for a State to imbibe a general belief, that all who differ from the State-Religion, are factious to the civil Power, and not to be ſuffered, and ſo to puniſh them as ſuch, and if they be not ſo, to tempt them thereby to be ſo, is to do an act of injuſtice to them, and to forfeit their own prudence towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>For the Errors you may ſuppoſe men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed withal; as an eager Perſecution is apt to make the Profeſſors of them think them more than ordinary Truths, and themſelves ſome great men in maintaining them; ſo it makes others ſeek after that, when driven into a Corner, which were it in the open Streets no man would regard. He that preaches and writes under reſtraint, that reſtraint begets him readers and hearers, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62983:59"/> would elſe paſs through the World with very little notice taken of him; things difficult and hard to come by, carry ſome weight in mens expectancy: Fooliſh and abſurd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are only put to Nurſe by Perſecution, and by that made to have ſomething in the concerns and fears of others, which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing in it ſelf. The hiding men by a keen purſuit after them, in the profeſſion of ſuch things, keeps them alive; whereas if they were openly preached, written, and diſcourſed of, the folly of them would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſuch, as not only others, but the men themſelves would be aſhamed and a weary of them: Beſides, puniſhing men for Religion, where there are ſeveral parties, lays a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of endleſs troubles and perpetual feuds: for that ill Opinion and anger, which makes one party, when prevaling to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and puniſh the reſt, propagates ſtill the ſame anger and diſlike in the parties puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and begets by ſuch provocation a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſolution to retort the ſame again, and a readineſs to embrace all opportunities to effect it; whereas that party that once gives liberty to the reſt, buries all thoſe Evils, and unites all in the common union of their own intereſt and ſecurity. 'Twill be impoſſible to find out a way for men of differing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Religion to live together, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the common advantages, which as men
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62983:60"/> they may afford one to another, unleſs they exerciſe an Indulgence to each other, in that variety they ſtand in as Chriſtians. Where there are many differences, and a State de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes any Liberty, but ſtrictly impoſeth the State-Religion upon all, the caſe always falls out to be, that the earneſt deſire of that we call <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> lies glowing in the Embers of mens diſcontent, and is a thing in it ſelf ſo popular, a thing of ſo great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon, when it may be diſcourſed upon equal terms, and ſo much the concern of every man, but the preſent Impoſer, that 'tis very apt to kindle and flame out, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſtrait or emergency of State, either by Forreign War, or Domeſtick Diviſion, to make ſuch an Earthquake as may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the whole: 'Tis moſt prudent in a State to give Liberty, when there is leaſt power to demand it; thoſe may be gained by giving it, that may prove dangerous in forcing it: To force and pen men up in ſuch things is wholly unnatural, and will, like Wind pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in the Earth, or the Sea ſhut up by Banks, break out at one time or another with the greater violence. Liberty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was never yet denyed in a <hi>Proteſtant State,</hi> but it had firſt or laſt a <hi>miſchievous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> To inſtruct men in <hi>Proteſtant Principles,</hi> and then to put a Yoke of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> upon them, hath no more proportion in it, than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62983:60"/> to educate a man at <hi>Geneva</hi> that is to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to breed him a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> whom you intend for a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were there no other reaſon to make a <hi>Prince</hi> or a <hi>State</hi> out of love with puniſhing men for Religion, and matters of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this were ſufficient; to conſider ſuch puniſhment ever falls upon the moſt honeſt of his Subjects in every differing party; men of looſe jugling principles and unſound hearts will be ſure to eſcape the Net; only the ſincere plain-hearted man, that cannot diſſemble, is caught; 'twas the device a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Daniel</hi> heretofore, they knew, in the matters of his God, 'twas eaſie to deal with him, becauſe in thoſe he would not upon any terms diſſemble.</p>
                  <p>This has Three ill Effects always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It diſobliges the beſt ſort of men in every party, whom the State ſhould moſt cheriſh and engage; whatever is ſaid to the contrary, thoſe that are the trueſt Subjects to the Great King, will be alſo found the beſt to his Vice-gerents here: 'Tis a ſtrange Heterodox kind of policy, to make all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſincere men in a Nation of every party, but that one the State adheres to, the object of the States diſpleaſure, and to make Laws that can have no other effect but their Suffering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> All ſtanders-by, the generality
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62983:61"/> of a Nation looking on, muſt needs be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, to ſee a plain honeſt man, upright and punctual in all his dealings amongſt men, puniſhed meerly for his Conſcience to God; and becauſe he will not comply to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which nothing but his Conſcience can lead him to, and by parting with which he may at any time purchaſe his quiet; in ſuch a caſe common Ingenuity begets pity for him, if not <hi>Proſelites</hi> to him, and great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the courſe taken with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though it be a ſecret, yet 'tis a very ſure and certain way of bringing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Judgments</hi> upon a <hi>People;</hi> no doubt God takes great notice of the puniſhing men, meerly becauſe they are true to him; for ſo every man is, that is true to his Conſcience, though it be erroneous. Upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was it that <hi>Paul</hi> juſtified himſelf before the High-Prieſt, in ſaying, <hi>He had walked before God in all good Conſcience to that time.</hi> His meaning was, He had gone according to his light, as a thing pleaſing to God, though otherwiſe, as to the matter, his Conſcience was erroneous, and his Judgment miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And he tells us afterwards, <hi>That he obtained Mercy from God,</hi> becauſe what he did againſt the Church was done Ignorantly, and in purſuance of the beſt Light he then had.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhing men meerly for following
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62983:61"/> the pure dictates of Conſcience, is no doubt the true cauſe of many National miſeries; And a State ſhould be careful to avoid this, as they would preſerve their own ſafety &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. If we look into that which naturally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth ſeveral Opinions in Religion, 'tis that which a Prince ſhould for his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt highly encourage, and that is Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for no doubt, as Knowledge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, it expatiates it ſelf into variety of Thoughts and Principles; and as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth all other Sciences, ſo Religion. Knowledge is the Glory of a Nation, and that by which all matters of concern to it, as War, Trade, Policy, and every thing elſe is highly enlarged. 'Tis the high Honour of a Prince to govern a Wiſe and a Knowing People, as well as a Great People; 'Tis an impotent piece of Policy, and equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all publick Intereſt, to ſay, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects muſt be kept ignorant,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>They muſt be kept poor.</hi> They are Maximes only fitted for a Tyrant, and ſuch who only govern for themſelves, and calculate all Intereſts, at they concenter in their own, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make themſelves their own Idols. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing damps all Noble Undertakings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men of Conſcience like Impoſition in Religion; it makes them hang down their Heads, it makes them heartleſs in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. If they are denied freedom in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62983:62"/> men of Conſcience will care little for any thing elſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>A wounded Spirit no man can bear.</hi> He that carries a taint of trouble in his mind about theſe things, is impotent in every thing; 'tis Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Religion that breeds the noble and generous minds. Let a man know his duty to God, and have freedom to perform it, and that man will have Wiſdom &amp; Courage above any man. Impoſing Religion upon men has never other effect than either to lull men aſleep into implicit ignorance, and ſo make them as ſottiſh and uſeleſs Members of a State, as they are of the Church, or elſe, where it meets with Knowledge and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, ſinks men under the greateſt grief, and provokes them to the greateſt diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. If we look amongſt our ſelves, who be they that deſire favour in this particular? And who be they that will be gratified and engaged by it, but every where men of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principles? And are they not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſober and ſerious men that bring good to a Nation? Are not they in all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Trades generally moſt induſtrious and thriving? Are not they moſt ſaving in their Expences, and every way, either in War or Peace, moſt uſeful and ſerviceable? 'Tis debauched, looſe, expenſive people that over-live their Eſtates, and neglect their Callings, that help to pull a State down;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62983:62"/> ſuch men will be ſure to Conform to any thing, that ſecures them in preſent Luxury: 'Tis the Sober, Serious, Religious ſort of men that every way make a Nation proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; to diſcontent ſuch, and to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one common Dungeon of imputed Faction and actual Perſecution, will never be found any right meaſure of a true National Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Several things with great Evidence, ſeem to plead for Moderation and Indulgence here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Number and Quantity of thoſe concerned, as well as the Quality, is ſuch, that it can be no way prudent to diſcontent them upon that which will no way compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate the inconvenience; there can be no good Policy to leave ſo many men mixed every where, even in the higheſt places of the Nation under diſſatisfaction, without the leaſt effect, but the reproach of imprudence in doing it; and to put a diſgraceful diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character upon them, as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the State, only becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comply with ſome Ceremonies (as the caſe is general amongſt us) and worſhip God juſt in the publick way, a thing of no more intrinſick concern to the State, than to have all men of the ſame Opinion in a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted point of Philoſophy, and a thing of as equal likelihood to be attain'd. A Subject that gives the ſame Teſtimony
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62983:63"/> of his Fidelity to his Prince that others do, and behaves himſelf in all civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns as a faithful and profitable Member of the Common-wealth, and yet is looked upon as a publick enemy, and made the object of publick anger, becauſe he cannot in every Circumſtance comply with the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is without doubt very ſeverely and impolitically dealt with. As every Subject hath an Intereſt in his natural Prince, ſo hath the Prince in every Subject, and ſhould be like the true Mother that would by no means divide the Child. To take ſuch a courſe is to furniſh out a party ready; for whoever firſt makes a diſturbance, nay, its to tempt men ſo to do, by ſeeing a party ſo prepared.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> be once fitly given, and the Root of all mens hopes and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that deſire publick miſchief, is pulled up, and the King will be the greateſt and the moſt beloved Prince that ever yet ſate upon the Throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall never have a flouriſhing Trade without it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, Becauſe the preſſure in theſe things falls generally more upon the Trading ſort of men, than any in the Nation; we may ſee it in the great City, and in all Copora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; It makes many give over Trading, and retire; It makes others remove into <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Forreign parts, as it did
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62983:63"/> heretofore from <hi>Norwich,</hi> to the irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prejudice of our Cloathing-Trade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like occaſion; And it certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents all <hi>Proteſtant Strangers</hi> to come to live and trade amongſt us. It puts great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages into the hands of the <hi>Hollander</hi> every way, who have not a better Friend in <hi>Europe</hi> than <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> As <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> here is that they fear above any thing, ſo it would inſenſibly more weaken them than all the Victories we have obtained over them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Men will never trade freely where they do not live and converſe freely: Where a man is afraid to be watched to a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and moſt of the time he ſerves God is fain to hide himſelf; no man will chuſe to live ſo if he can avoid it: Every man that cannot conform to the publick Religion, lying under the laſh of the Law, will pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhun both Buſineſs and Company, will never lay out his Eſtate where 'tis in any mans power to do him a miſchief. A man conſcious to himſelf that he cannot comply with the Law, will avoid medling with any thing, and chuſe privacy as his beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This we have had a ſufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who for many years, ever ſince they lay under the laſh of the penal Laws, have been of little uſe to the Nation, have retreated from all publick
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62983:64"/> Commerce amongſt us, kept their Money by them, ſent their Children abroad, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned themſelves from all the publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, 'Tis the King of <hi>England</hi>'s true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to become Head of all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party in the World; and he will never do that, but by firſt making himſelf a common Father to all his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects at home. That 'tis his Intereſt to head the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party abroad, is plain, becauſe being the greateſt and moſt powerful of all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes and States, he will neceſſarily draw them into a dependance upon him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Protection from him; by which not only the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt in it ſelf will be much ſecured by being ſo united and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, but the King of <hi>England</hi> alſo will receive a great Acceſſion of Power, by the Influence he will have on ſo great a part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which he may make uſe of, not only to ſecure the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion againſt the common Enemy of it, but to advantage himſelf every way, by the great reſpect and intereſt he will have in all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> States.</p>
                  <p>To bring the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> into an Union amongſt themſelves, will be of advantage to every <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-State, but to none ſo much as <hi>England:</hi> Firſt, Becauſe <hi>England</hi> natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes the Head of ſuch a Union: And ſecondly, Becauſe the Deſigns and Practices
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62983:64"/> of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party ever ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have lain and will lie more united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>England</hi> than any <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-State, as ſuppoſing that the chief Support of all the reſt; and therefore <hi>England</hi> can never be truly ſafe, nor ſecured in its proper Intereſt, but when 'tis inviron'd with all <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-States adhearing to it, and depending upon it. How ſadly <hi>England</hi> has miſcarried, when it has eſpouſed any other collateral Intereſt but the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> has been too obvious ever ſince the firſt Reformation: <hi>England</hi> has been always greateſt at home, when it has been the greateſt Defender of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Faith abroad. Now if the King will thus rightly ſtate his Intereſt abroad, he muſt begin the work at home; if he perſecute and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects at home, thoſe of their Opinion abroad will never put themſelves under his protection: As he muſt make no diſtinction in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ſo he muſt make no other amongſt his Subjects at home. He that impoſeth any one Opinion amongſt <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> and will tolerate no other, makes the diſtinction to be ſtill between <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> and makes himſelf but Head of a Party amongſt them, and will never ſo head the <hi>Protestant</hi> Intereſt as to oppoſe the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party with it, or unite the <hi>Protestants</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62983:65"/> ſo under him, as to make them acknowledge him for their Head.</p>
                  <p>Whoever would be Head of all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Intereſt, muſt have no common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but <hi>Popery,</hi> and concenter all there: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Conformity to the Opinion of any one <hi>Protestant</hi> party upon all the reſt, is but to make himſelf ſo much the weaker by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſſenter, and is indeed totally deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the very being of ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience is the beſt way to ſecure us to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith, and to prevent a relapſe to <hi>Popery;</hi> the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion will be faſteſt rooted by exerting fully the Principles of it, and a throughout adhearing to them: By our practice in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another, to deny thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by which we juſtifie our Separation from <hi>Rome,</hi> is the ready way to make them return thither again. <hi>Teach men, that there is no man nor men under any one denomination ſince the Apoſtles time, that are infallible in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Divine Truth. Teach men, that the Scripture is the only Rule of Religion, and let them read it: Tell them, they are to follow no men farther than they follow that Rule; and that every man is Judge according to the best Light he hath of that Rule, and how far other men comply with it, and differ from it: And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62983:65"/> that every man is bound to behave himſelf towards God, according to the Judgment he ſhall ſo make within himſelf:</hi> All which are Proteſtant Principles and Eternal Truths. And then collect the ſenſe which theſe Principles iſſue themſelves into, and how unreaſonable will it then appear to force men to comply with the belief of others, contrary to their own? And when you have bid them uſe their Light and Reaſon to puniſh them, becauſe they will not oppoſe it, and go againſt it; How can we otherwiſe juſtitie forcing men, where ſuch Principles are avowed, but by a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of them, and recurring to thoſe Popiſh Weapons of the abſolute Power of the Church, and her uncontrolable Authority? And ſo by condemning others, that upon the exerciſe of their own Light and Reaſon now differ from us, condemn our ſelves, who upon the ſame at firſt departed from <hi>Rome.</hi> When we oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we juſtifie our ſelves upon the very ſame Arguments, by which Diſſenters now amongſt our ſelves make their defence againſt us; And when we diſpute againſt them, we take up the ſame Arguments the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe againſt us: There is ſcarce any conſiderable Argument urged of late for Conformity and Impoſition, but if you trace it to the Seat, you ſhall find it in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Suarez.</hi> The truth is, he that cannot indure to have any differ from him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62983:66"/> in Opinion, about the ſupernatural Truth of the Goſpel, and will have no toleration of ſeveral perſwaſions of that kind; and thinks it deſtructive to mankind, and the being of every State, to ſuffer any ſo to be; That man is a Proteſtant by miſtake, and will find himſelf at home in his Principles no where but at <hi>Rome.</hi> The farther we remove in our Reformation from the Practices and Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and live upon our own, the leſs like we are to return to it. If we make uſe of their Arguments and Principles at one time, we may come to uſe them at another, and at laſt eſpouſe them altogether; and what ſerves our turns at ſome times to oppoſe others, may at laſt prevail upon our ſelves. And ſo it is in our Practices, reſerving any of their Ceremonies, may at laſt bring us to ſome of their Doctrines. He that keeps a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is within a ſtep of praying to that Saint for whoſe ſake he keeps it, eſpecially if he have the wit to conſider why he keeps it. He that kneels and puts weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, is in a fair way to adoration; and he that is for joyning the Croſs with Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, may come to do it after Grace, and croſs himſelf in time. 'Twas Biſhop <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's</hi> obſervation, when he ſaw the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and how many of the Popiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were retained, being asked, what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62983:66"/> he thought of it? <hi>If they like</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the taste of our Broth ſo well, they will eat of our Beef ſhortly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience is the great means to diffuſe Goſpel-knowledge in divine things, and that's the beſt and ſureſt way to bar out Popery, and lock the Door upon it forever. Ignorance is the great and only preparative for implicit ſubjection. <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> cannot (I dare ſay) afford an inſtance that ever any State or People, where Divine-Knowledge by Liberty of Conſcience, and a Liberty for the Goſpel was once ſpread, were in the leaſt danger of turning Apoſtates to <hi>Popery,</hi> but have grown daily more and more into a deteſtation of it, and generally almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man amongſt them carrying a Weapon in his underſtanding to defend the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Were Liberty of Conſcience granted in <hi>Italy</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh</hi> States, we ſhould ſoon ſee the Mitre totter upon the Popes Head, and probably ſee as fair Churches there as in any other part of <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Twas obſerved in the Wars of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that when ever any <hi>Catholick</hi> began to look into the Bible, he was not long-liv'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Profeſſion.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62983:67"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience will breed men up with an irreconcilable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all Impoſition in Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo unite them in a general ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of POPERY, as the grand Mother and Author of it all <hi>Chistendom</hi> over: All Principles and Parties born from a Liberty given in Religion, have an Antipathy in them to that <hi>Romiſh Yoke,</hi> and do naturally unite againſt the <hi>Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as the grand and common Enemy of them all.</p>
                  <p>Let Liberty of Conſcience once be given in a <hi>Protestant</hi>-State, and though there be never ſo many differences amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet men of all perſwaſions will concenter in that. He that has the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Religion will be concerned to defend it, and look upon <hi>Popery</hi> as the great Grant he is in danger of. Experience and Fact, the beſt of all demonſtrations, do evidence this. Take a view of thoſe places where Liberty of Conſcience hath been moſt given, and you will find there the greateſt averſion to <hi>Popery</hi> that is in any parts of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis in other places, where other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Impoſition and Perſecution are uſed, that compliance with <hi>Popery</hi> hath been attempted, and projects ſet on foot to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62983:67"/> compound the <hi>Protestant</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Agreement.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Impoſition in Religion ſweeps the Houſe, and keeps the Neſt warm for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:</hi> Liberty of Conſcience mortally ſtabs it; where that is once given, it may be ſaid to the Pope, as it was to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar, God hath numbred thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and finiſhed it; And the place where he once Tyrannized, ſhall know him there no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own Intereſt, as we have good reaſon to believe they do, this Caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to our hands: for upon every occaſion ſince the Reformation, both in <hi>Germany, France, Swiſſerland,</hi> and all places where Liberty of Conſcience hath been endeavoured, the Popes have <hi>toto animo,</hi> every way oppoſed it, and declared it a thing perfectly deſtructive to the Church, and ſuch, as where-ever it was ſuffered, would deſtroy the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith; and in that Maxim, <hi>I believe their Infallibility is not much to be denied.</hi> Some are ſo much otherwiſe-minded, that they believe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience will be the ready means to induce <hi>Popery</hi> again amongſt us; The Reaſons of it ſeem inviſible, unleſs it be done by ſome new Rule of contraries: It
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62983:68"/> muſt either come to paſs by giving Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general to <hi>Protestants</hi> of differing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, or elſe by giving Liberty to the <hi>Papists</hi> themſelves, as included in a general Liberty.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt (I hope) it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to have another tendency.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſecond, The giving Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Papists</hi> themſelves amongſt us, no man well informed, can imagine that they ſhould be included in any ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe in their Practice amongſt us, they refuſe to give that publick aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance every Subject ought to give of his Fidelity that expects the favour due to a Subject.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Becauſe their Principles are ſuch, that if they underſtand their own Religion, they can never be good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> State: He that knows not this, knows not the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN RELIGION. And to prove it ſo by Fact;</p>
                  <p>Amongſt very many other Inſtances, let what was done here in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to her, and at the ſame time in <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, forever lie upon Record againſt them. Nor can a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62983:68"/> 
                     <hi>Papiſt</hi> ever become a true and hearty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince, but by that act he ceaſeth to be ſo. And as common Juſtice does deny them all pretentions to Liberty, ſo common Equity oppoſeth them; for as both they and their Religion abhor giving Liberty to any but themſelves, ſo is their practice accordingly; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give Liberty to a Soul living, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from them, where they are able and dare deny it.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, <hi>That Liberty of Conſcience can have no other effect, but to tolerate damnable Hereſies, and all kind of Sectaries,</hi> which is the uſual way of diſcourſing it; <hi>and ſo to enlarge into all kind of Satyrical Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick upon that Topick,</hi> is to put a Bears skin upon it, and then to bait it. 'Twill be to impoſe a thing of a very hard belief upon me, to ſay, That Truth never gains by Liberty, and that the Impoſer is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the right, and the Sufferer in the wrong; eſpecially conſidering, he that thinks me an Heretick, another thinks him ſo, and a fourth thinks us all ſo; and all the while we are all of us weak, imperfect, fallible men, ſitting in judgment, and ſentencing one another: And there can be no other end of it, but that he that is ſtrongeſt makes himſelf in the right, and deſtroys the reſt. When ever Truth comes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62983:69"/> to ſuffer by Impoſition, as many times it does, and comes afterwards to be ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the evil of ſuch Impoſition carries its own evidence.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe ſuch Truth never gets any good, and Liberty ſhould be only to men under Errors and Miſtakes, 'twere not fit then to deny it, that is, 'twere not fit then to impoſe upon them; for Liberty is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Negative upon Force and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: If we conſult the good of ſuch men themſelves, ſo lapſed into Error, and deſire their Converſion, Force and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is no way to it; If we conſult our own Security, there is no danger at all can come by it; for as long as ſuch Errors lie in the underſtanding, and are only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about ſupernatural things, they have no reference at all to the being or well-being of Mankind, as ſuch: What hurt does an Error in Religion do me in my Neighbour, that is otherwiſe an honeſt and good man? He is rather in that an object of my Pity and Inſtruction, than of my Anger.</p>
                  <p>If we deſire to have all men of our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe we think we are in the right, 'tis a very commendable thing; and if we do it with ſuch a publick Charity, we ſhall uſe only ſuch Chriſtian means as naturally conduce to bring it about. But, if through
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62983:69"/> the Pride of mens Hearts, and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own Exaltation thereby, they will have every body of their Opinion; and becauſe they cannot convince and perſwade them, will therefore force them, and trample upon them, that's an Odious Super-intendency.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, That upon a prudential Account, Liberty ſhould never be allowed in a State, becauſe 'tis that which will unite Parties, and bring them to a Conſiſtency amongſt themſelves, and ſo render them much more dangerous, is to ſay a thing upon a great Miſtake. For common Experience ſhews us, That nothing unites Parties more amongſt themſelves, than a hot Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For does any thing bring them ſo much together as that? 'Tis like a great Storm that drives Cattel, that are ſcattered about, altogether, and brings them to meet in one common ſhelter to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ridly</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> agreed in the Goal, that would hardly have diſputed themſelves Friends.</p>
                  <p>There is no Bond of Union amongſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Perſons like PERSECUTION: The common Concern of their Security then begets Correſpondency, Acquaintance, and ſuch Intercourſe and mutual Aſſiſtance,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62983:70"/> as endears them above any thing one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And for the Danger there may be of any Party, there is nothing ſure ſo like to remove that, as indulging them with a Liberty: The beſt way to be ſecured againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of any Party, is to remove the Cauſe of ſuch Diſcontent; and the beſt way to be out of fear of them, unleſs you can totally deſtroy them, is to oblige them, and ſo at once to engage and win them over, and thereby disband our own Fears.</p>
                  <p>A late Author tells us, with particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>That</hi> Maecenus <hi>heretofore gave advice to</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>That upon no terms he ſhould endure ſuch who would bring in any ſtrange Worſhip into the State.</hi> I believe it, and 'twas ſuch kind of Advice (no doubt) that cauſed the Ten firſt Perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>Methinks the Author ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, That that advice would have kept Chriſtianity out of the World. For if we follow the Track of ſuch Policy, we ſhall find, that what we now ſay againſt Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſſenters amongſt our ſelves, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> firſt ſaid, and do ſtill ſay againſt us all; and if we go one ſtep higher, the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ſaid the very ſame againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion it ſelf, and thought it a Factious,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62983:70"/> Fanatick Project of ſick-brain'd men, and a thing not to be endured, that men ſhould not content themſelves with the ſame Godds that the reſt of World worſhipped and acquieſced in. 'Tis a ſad thing, and much to be lamented, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould take up the Dregs of thoſe Politicks, and make uſe of them one againſt another, upon very ſmall difference amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author, in another part of his Book propounds this Queſtion:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If divers ways of Worſhip (ſaith he) be allowed in a Nation, what ſhall a Prince do? If he keep any men of any Profeſſion or Party out of Employment for their Opinion ſake, he diſobliges that Party: If he bring all men indifferently alike into Employment, if he be of any Party himſelf, he will diſoblige his own Party, who will expect Pre-eminence in that kind; and ſo in Concluſion, by endeavouring to pleaſe all, he will loſe all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a Knot very eaſily untied. I will ſuppoſe a Prince ſtrict in the Profeſſion and Practice of what he thinks is the Truth; and the more ſtrict Perſonally he is, the greater will the favour of Indulgence appear to thoſe that differ from him: But there is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62983:71"/> no neceſſity that he ſhould make a Party of thoſe who are of his Opinion, diſtinct from the reſt of his Subjects: 'Tis below his Greatneſs, and beſides his Intereſt ſo to do; they will ſoon become like the Sons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah,</hi> and in time grow to be too hard for him. Thoſe that are of his Opinion, he may think them (in his private judgment) better <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than others; but there is no Policy ſo to diſtinguiſh them, as if they were thereby better Subjects than others.</p>
                  <p>All men in a State are to give one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aſſurance of their Fidelity; and ſuch who are allowed a Liberty in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when differing from the publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the Political end of it is, to make them good Subjects; and the end of that muſt needs be, to make them ſerviceable to their Prince: And there is no Reaſon to doubt, but that they will be ſo, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſo, becauſe they lie under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his Favour, thoſe of his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are not capable of.</p>
                  <p>A Prince ſhould ſeat himſelf in his Throne with an equal Political Aſpect to all his Subjects, and employ them as their fitneſs for his Service qualifies them: There is no Reaſon to narrow and limit a Prince to any Party, or to let any Party grow into
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62983:71"/> ſuch a Praedominant Opinion, as if the Prince were confin'd to them.</p>
                  <p>No mans bare Opinion in ſuch things ſhould qualifie him for an Employment, nor no mans Opinion ought to put a Negative upon him in that kind: that is for a Prince after he has obliged all his Subjects to him, to loſe the uſe of a great part of them. Let a Prince but chuſe men to ſerve him, whoſe Ability and Fitneſs carries the evidence of his Choice, and other Exceptions will ſoon vaniſh. 'Tis below the Greatneſs of a Prince to have any Subject to pretend to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment upon any ſcore but his Judgment of his fitneſs for it.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> hath often with good ſucceſs employed his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects;</hi> Nay, has often truſted the Command of his whole Army in the hand of the Proteſtant, and yet feared not the diſobliging of the Popiſh Party, or being thought a man of no Religion for ſo doing. 'Tis a moſt Abſurd and Impolitick thing, becauſe men differ in ſome divine ſupernatural things, to put them under ſuch Characters, as to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful one to another in all other humane things.</p>
                  <p>Let a Prince once give Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and he obliges all Parties to him, and makes them wholly depend upon him;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62983:72"/> the Tenor of their Liberty will be a Tenor <hi>in Capite,</hi> and <hi>Quam diu ſe bene geſſerint;</hi> and for employing men, and diſpenſing favours to them, let all Parties with a due ſubjection lie under the Prerogative and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Two things are with much earneſtneſs uſually Objected againſt the Grant of Liberty:</p>
                  <p>Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is unbecoming the Zeal and Concern a Magiſtrate ſhould have for the Truth of Religion to give Liberty to any thing but what he thinks to be ſo; and that ſuch a Lukewarmneſs, as Liberty to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Opinions ſuppoſeth, does no way become him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That giving Liberty to men of ſeveral Opinions, is the way to Propagate and Encreaſe them, and is of great danger to a State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Firſt:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very fit that the Magiſtrate ſhould eſpouſe what he thinks to be the Truth, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62983:72"/> keep himſelf to the ſtrict Practice of it, and uſe all lawful means to poſſeſs others with it; let him uſe all the means Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles uſed to convince and convert men; but let him not lay Violent hands upon mens Perſons, becauſe he cannot ſatisfie their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: That's Zeal without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Religion without a Rule, either in Reaſon or Divinity: That is to run into ſo wide an Extream from <hi>Laodecean</hi> Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, as to become like <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, who ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That he was Mad, Perſecuting the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſay, A Magiſtrate is Lukewarm in Religion, becauſe he will not Force men to his Opinion, is to ſay, He is Lukewarm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not do a thing that Chriſt hath no where required of him; and to do a thing that is to no purpoſe to do, for that very end for which it is done.</p>
                  <p>Tolerating men has no more in it, than not Forcing men: 'Tis only a Negative Favour, there is nothing Affirmative in it. A Magiſtrate will never be charged with Lukewarmneſs in Religion, that makes uſe of all Goſpel means to promote Truth, and that he may do, and yet never violate the due Liberty of any mans Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>If we conſult the Antient Practice of the firſt Chriſtian Magiſtrates, we ſhall find it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62983:73"/> plain, That Liberty of Conſcience was given by the Chriſtian Emperors. <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> did it fully. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Life time tells us, That he made a Decree in theſe words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t parem cum Fidelibus, ij qui errant, pacis &amp; quietis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant.</hi> 'Tis true, he baniſhed <hi>Arrius;</hi> but let any man conſult the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and he ſhall find <hi>Arrius</hi> ſo Factious and Baſe a Perſon, that there needed no part of his Opinion to be the cauſe of his Exile. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> the Emperor made likewiſe a Decree for Liberty in Religion. The <hi>Jews</hi> had granted by all the Emperors, the ſame Rights with other <hi>Chriſtians. Jovinian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> moſt Noble Princes, ſuffered Chriſtians of ſeveral Perſwaſions to enjoy their Liberty: Of this, <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>De Imp. Sum. Poteſ. Circ. Sac. Cap.</hi> 8. takes particular notice, adding theſe words, and ſaith, which is more to be Noted, <hi>The Emperor did not only permit Jmpunity to Diſagreeing Sects, but often made Laws to order their Aſſemblies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Liberty therefore in Religion is not either ſo new, or ſo ſtrange a thing, or ſo great a Monſter as men would make it. State-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions are not always Infallibly true; Truth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62983:73"/> ſometimes keeps men from embracing them, it doth ſo in many parts of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and in that caſe a Negative Reſtraint upon the Magiſtrates compulſion, is the only ſhelter of Truth. The Wiſdom of Chriſt, who hath forbid the uſe of the Temporal power under the Goſpel, about Religion, hath left things beſt. For if a Magiſtrate be in the right, he may promote Truth, as far as in the nature of the thing, and by Chriſt's appointment, it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; If he be not in the right, where the Temporal Power does not interpoſe, men are ſecured in the profeſſion of Truth, and not hazarded in refuſing a publick Error.</p>
                  <p>He that would have the Magiſtrate force all men to his Religion, will himſelf be burnt by his own Principles, when he comes into a Country where the State-Religion differs from him: To ſay, He is in the right, and the State that does it in the wrong, is a miſerable begging the Queſtion. If one Magiſtrate be to do it, all are to do it, and there can be no other Rule of Truth and Error in that caſe, but what they think ſo. If a Magiſtrate be once admitted to puniſh with Death, what is really and truly in it ſelf an Hereſie, he may and muſt by the ſame Rule, ſo puniſh every thing he thinks
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62983:74"/> ſo: Where ſhall the Definition of Hereſie terminate? And who ſhall ſet the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate bounds in ſuch a caſe? Miſ-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Paſſion, or ſome ſiniſter Intereſt can only lead men into ſuch Principles, which tend to nothing but to make Religion diſturb the peace and quiet of all Mankind; and as one ſaith well, <hi>To bring Chriſtians to a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery one of another, and to make a meer Shambles of Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Second Objection:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That giving Liberty to ſeveral Parties, Encreaſeth them, and makes them dangerous to a State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis very fit, that whereſoever you will ſuppoſe Errors to be ſprung up, all the means Chriſt hath appointed for that end, ſhould be uſed to ſuppreſs them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim men from them: Let their Mouthes be ſtopped with ſound Doctrine, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Cenſures; the only Queſtion is about the uſe of the temporal Power in ſuch things: And Experience tells us, That ſince the World began, to this day, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Opinions in the Mind were never extinguiſhed by the puniſhing the Body: That old Saying verifies it,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62983:74"/>
                     <q>Sanguis Martyrum, Semem Eccleſiae.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, there is nothing under the Sun to promote an Opinion in Religion, like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men ſuffer for it: The Conſtancy and Courage of men in ſuffering for an Opinion, will ſooner perſwade men to it, than all the Diſcourſes and Sermons in the World.</p>
                  <p>If the Magiſtrate take a Violent courſe to root out all different Opinions in Religion, ſuch as the Emperors heretofore, when Heathen, took with the Chriſtians, and the Popiſh States, where they are able, do at this day with the Proteſtants; beſides the Cruelty of it, with which he will beſmear himſelf, he will miſs of his end, and find a Succeſſion of thoſe Principles in others, riſing out of the Aſhes of thoſe Deſtroys, as it uſed to be ſaid heretofore by the Martyrs;</p>
                  <q>Quoties morimur, toties naſcimur.</q>
                  <p>If he take a mild and more gentle way of Perſecution, he only exaſperates them, and then leaves them arm'd with all poſſible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to hurt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſider the giving Liberty under theſe two Heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The giving of it to ſeveral Opinions
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62983:75"/> and Parties, where they are already actually exiſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Secondly, <hi>The giving Liberty ſo, as will occaſion and produce ſuch Parties and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Firſt;</hi> Where there are ſeveral Parties in Religion already in being, and diffuſed all over a Nation, as the caſe is with us, there is no way to ſecure them, but to indulge them; for they are by their Number outgrown the Political part of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Second</hi> Conſideration of Liberty, the giving it ſo as will naturally produce ſeveral Principles and Opinions in men; he that would prevent that, muſt give no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Proteſtant Religion, muſt not let the Bible be read by the Vulgar: There is no way to keep out ſeveral Opinions in Religion, but an implicit ignorant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to an impoſed Infallibility, and to do as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, who will not have any Learning or Diſcourſe amongſt them of Religion, for that very Reaſon, becauſe they will have no Religion but <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor no Learning but the <hi>Alcoran: <hi>Such Policy to Murder mens Souls, is hatcht in Hell!</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:62983:75"/>
                  <p>The Art of <hi>Printing</hi> was at the firſt thought dangerous, becauſe it was looked on as a thing like to introduce ſeveral Opinions in Religion. Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> in a Letter of his to the Pope, hath this Paſſage about it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That his Holineſs could not be ignorant what divers Effects the New Invention of</hi> Printing <hi>had produced; for as it had brought in and reſtored Books and Learning, ſo together it hath been the occaſion of theſe Sects and Schiſms which daily appear in the World, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in</hi> Germany, <hi>where men begin now to call in queſtion the preſent Faith and Tenents of the Church, and to examine how far Religion is departed from its Primitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And that which particularly was moſt to be lamented, they had exhorted the Lay and Ordinary men to read the Scriptures and to Pray in their Vulgar Tongue. That if this were ſuffered, beſides all other dangers, the common People at laſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62983:76"/> might come to believe that there was not ſo much uſe of the Clergy; for if men were perſwaded once they could make their own way to God, and that Prayers in their native and ordinary Language might pierce Heaven, as well as in Latin, How much would the Authority of the Maſs fall? How Prejudicial might this prove unto all our Eccleſiaſtical Orders?</hi> Lord <hi>Herberts</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Liberty of Conſcience lies as naturally neceſſary to a <hi>Proteſtant State,</hi> as Impoſition to a <hi>Popiſh State;</hi> he muſt be a good Artiſt that can find a right middle way between theſe two. 'Tis the Glory of Proteſtant-States, to have much of the Knowledge of God amongſt them, and that variety of mens Opinions, about ſome leſs weighty and more obſcure matters of Religion, as it much tends to a diſcovery of the Truth of them, ſo it no way breaks the Bond of Proteſtant Union, where men generally agree in the ſame Rule of Religion, and in all the chief and neceſſary Fundamentals of Salvation. Liberty of Conſcience in ſuch States, as it is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62983:76"/> their true and genuine Intereſt, and without which they will but deny themſelves thoſe advantages they might otherwiſe arrive at; ſo with the forementioned Boundaries, can never prove hurtful or dangerous, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always a juſt diſtinction to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who deſire only to ſerve God, and ſuch who pretend that, to become inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to men.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen, that not only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> but <hi>Reaſon,</hi> not only <hi>Duty</hi> but <hi>Intereſt,</hi> do invocate Princes and States in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: To whom it may fitly be ſaid, in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings; and be inſtructed, O ye Judges of the Earth.</hi>

                  <head>An EPISTLE Dedicated to the Noble <hi>BEREANS</hi> Of this Age.</head>
                  <p>HAving by the Book prefixed, laid before the Magiſtrates, and others concerned, a clear Demonſtration, and many weighty Arguments for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> to all <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> who deſire to live a peaceable Life under the Government. I am now come to treat on the Religious Differences amongſt us the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therein to vindicate the <hi>Chriſtian-Quakers</hi> (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Primitive Principles) and defend their Plea for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> from the Calumny and Reproach which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators</hi> have put upon both it and the Pleaders thereof; as if the Tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to introduce <hi>Looſneſs, Ranteriſm,</hi> or the like ſort of Abominations; all which we deteſt and deny: And in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the <hi>Accuſ.</hi> &amp;c. they have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62983:79"/> Sentenced <hi>William Rogers</hi> to be no <hi>Quaker,</hi> by which they mean, no <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> for if I may be in their account a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and yet no <hi>Quaker,</hi> then what damage is it to be no <hi>Quaker:</hi> So that as the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and others (about the Year 72. by their Dialogues, and otherwiſe) rendred us no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe our <hi>Creed</hi> lay not litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their 8th. <hi>Article of Faith:</hi> So doth the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> and <hi>Innovator</hi> endeavour to Unchriſtian the true <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker.</hi> And the two principal Reaſons that can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt us, are; <hi>Firſt,</hi> our Nonſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Nonconformity to the New Order of the Women, Erected by <hi>G.

                     <q>The Inſatiable Thirſt of men after Religious or Civil Empire, hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led almoſt every Age with Conteſt — There is ſomething in Man that prompts to Religion, and ſuch as ſtand not in the <hi>TRADITIONS</hi> of Men, nor any meer Formality. But Man, that he may not looſe the Honour of a Share — with an unwarrantable Activity, ſo Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terates by an Intermixture of his own Conceptions with their Divine Dictates, and purer Diſcoveries; SO Sophiſticates, that at the laſt they become more his own Workmanſhip than the Truth's: And ſo fond is he of this Child of his Brain, that like ſome Antient Tyrants, he will rather cut his way to the Throne by a violence upon all others Conſciences,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62983:80"/> than not put a Crown upon Its HEAD.</q>

                  <p>THe Main Thing intended by this Diſcourſe, is to ſhew the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> on Tender Conſciences, in Matters Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; that ſo, the ſame being diſcovered, may be laid aſide as a Burthen ſome Thing, and for time to come avoided, and <hi>Chriſtian-Liberty,</hi> inſtead thereof, introduced to all peaceable Subjects in every Nation. That this hath been the principal End of all <hi>Sound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writers,</hi> as well as of the Author of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of this Treatiſe, [Whoſe Name I know not, nor in what Form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor amongst what Society of People he walked; but yet his Judgment upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is my Judgment,] I can produce many Authors, as well from Antient and Modern Hiſtory, as <hi>Sacred Writ:</hi> wherefore to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſame, is no new thing.</p>
                  <p>But as it hath been the Work of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Pope</hi> may Err, nay, hath often Erred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is it may Buſineſs at this time, to ſhew that <hi>G.

                  </p>

                  <p>So it is my Concern at this time, to ſhew that our <hi>Yearly-Meeting,</hi> and other <hi>Synodical Aſſemblies,</hi> and that the <hi>Second-days Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may Err, nay, have often Erred.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62983:86"/> Holy Commandments, are fenced and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from hurt by Threats and Cenſures of Men.</p>
                     <p>For in a ſteady Belief of Chriſts Word, and in confidence of his Power and Protection, let all truly Conſcientious Chriſtians truſt; who ſaid, <hi>Mat. 5.6.7.

                     <p>And the largeſt Commiſſion that ever Chriſt gave his <hi>Deſciples</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was, <hi>Mat. 28.18, 19, 20.</hi> Where he ſaid, <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>bidding

                     <p>But if <hi>George Fox</hi> and his <hi>Party</hi> ſhall ſtiffly stand to it, <hi>That the</hi> Women-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>is of Divine Inſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Conformity, no Unity:</hi> I then would ask them, Whether Chriſt was deficient either in his delivering himſelf to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>Auditory,</hi> or in his <hi>Memory?</hi> And if in either, then in which did his Deficiency conſist? And who did he conſtitute in his room to ſupply that Defect?

If you ſay <hi>No,</hi> as you dare not ſay otherwiſe, then I make this reply, not at all granting a Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>That then his Spirit, or a Manifeſtation of it, is given to every man to profit withal.</hi> By which Rule; I have my proper Gift, and to my own Master I ſhall stand or fall: <hi>Who art thou then that Judgeſt another Mans Servant?</hi> Is not

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62983:89"/> to experience the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of this <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> ſo we held a publick Teſtimony thereof to others, that they might thereby be provoked to make tryal thereof, that ſo they might have the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in themſelves, and ſee for themſelves, and taſt for themſelves; and to this Word nigh in the Heart, were we committed and recommended, ſuitable to the Doctrine and Antient Propheſies of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and his Bleſſed <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Prophets:</hi> and in that Day, How did our <hi>Harmony</hi> ſound in our Aſſemblies? And how did our Love abound one towards another? And our Zeal for the Holy Name of our God. In this ſtood our <hi>Unity;</hi> in this ſtood our <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> even in that <hi>Inward Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> which God committed to us to bear for his Names ſake; here was the moving Cauſe of our Love to God &amp; one toward another; even the Inward Teſtimony or Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit, which God in his <hi>Infinite Love hath given us to profit withal:</hi> perſuant to his former Promiſes to our Fathers by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſaying; <hi>I will give Him for a Light to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and to be my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ends of the Earth: I will give him for a Commander, and a Leader to my People</hi> Iſrael. And as we came to believe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to experience the fulfilling of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62983:90"/> theſe <hi>Promiſes;</hi> and to be Witneſſes of the Vertue of this his Bleſſed Appearance; ſo we declare to others, that they alſo might believe, and have Fellowſhip with us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and the more we came thus to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-minded, and Spiritually-exerciſed; and the more we came to take delight therein, and to meditate therein, the more the Lord manifeſted his Love unto us, and his pure Power amongſt us, and became a Hedge about us, and a Wall unto us, and gave us Favour in the Sight of the People; Bleſſed and Praiſed be his Holy Name for ever.</p>
                  <p>And in that Day, when others would boaſt of their <hi>Church Authority,</hi> and <hi>Church Diſcipline, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Ceremonies, Comely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Decent Vestments,</hi> &amp;c. We told them the Spirit of God was the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Church, as well as the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets and Apoſtles: That Chriſt Jeſus, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, who is a Quickning Spirit, was <hi>Head</hi> of our <hi>Church, Lawgiver</hi> to our <hi>Church;</hi> on whoſe Shoulders the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> is laid; yea, the <hi>Hedge</hi> and <hi>Pale</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi> and able to preſerve our <hi>Church:</hi> and in this <hi>Faith</hi> we lived and walked in pure undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Love:</p>

                  <p>If any ſaid to us, <hi>Lo here is Christ, in this Ordinance, or in that Obſervation:</hi> We told them, <hi>Nay,</hi> Chriſt is within; and there they muſt wait to know Him, except they were <hi>Reprobates:</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is within; and there they muſt wait to receive the Earneſt of it: for it comes not by <hi>Outward Obſervations.</hi> This we told People: this we proved to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> This upon all occaſions we teſtified to all People, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> and <hi>Prophane, Bond</hi> and <hi>Free, Noble</hi> and <hi>Ignoble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they told us of their <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and how many they had, and of the Scripture being the Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We told them, That <hi>Faith</hi> was the Gift of God, and to be waited for; and that <hi>Faith</hi> was the Evidence of things not ſeen; and that although in the World there were <hi>Faiths</hi> many, and <hi>Lords</hi> many, yet to us there was but one <hi>Faith,</hi> and one <hi>Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who was the Author of that <hi>Faith.</hi> And that although the Scriptures were good, and a true Declaration of thoſe Things which were moſt ſurely believed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and by us ought to be believed, yet not the only <hi>Rule.</hi> But ſtill the Spirit of God, which was the Firſt <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Foundation Principle,</hi> the <hi>Palc,</hi> and only

                     <hi>Hedge</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and Sanctified People of God; ſo likewiſe it was the Rule of Life &amp; Practice firſt, and before any other Rule, and always had the Preheminency in our Teſtimony from the Beginning.</p>
                  <p>And if any queſtion the Truth of what I have here affirmed, then for Proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I refer them to the Teſtimonies of <hi>Iſaac Pennington, Edward Burrough, George Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>And in that Day, if any Brethren gave forth a Letter of <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> for the Help and Information of the weak, and lately Convinced. It was ſo worded, as that <hi>Chriſtian-Liberty</hi> was preſerved, and the People not Impos'd upon beyond their Freedom. And that it was ſo, I ſhall prove by an undeniable Inſtance in a Letter of <hi>Advice</hi> from the Brethren in the <hi>North,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty Years ſince, containing twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty particular Things, wherein <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> is given, yet SO as to leave them to their Freedom, and not to impoſe them further than Friends to whom they wrote, could receive them, or ſee a Service in them, as is evident, both from the <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Direction</hi> of the ſaid Paper, and alſo from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62983:91"/> the <hi>Cloſure</hi> and <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both which I ſhall here inſert; as alſo that <hi>Clauſe</hi> or particular <hi>Advice</hi> about <hi>Marriage,</hi> which is the ſeventh particular thing wherein Counſel is given in the ſaid <hi>Paper</hi> or <hi>Letter of Advice.</hi> That is to ſay,</p>

                  <p>This is the Title or Direction of the ſaid <hi>Letter of Advice:</hi> now follows the 7th. Particular, which is about Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That as any are moved of the Lord, and in his Light called to take a Brother or Siſter in Marriage (Marriage being honourable in all, and the Bed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled) let it be made known to the Children of Light, eſpecially to thoſe of the Meeting of which the Parties are Members, that all in the Light may it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be of God: and being in the Light made manifeſt to be of God, let them be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the Lord, and in his Fear, in the preſence of many Witneſſes; according to the Example of the Holy Men of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth recorded: which was written for our Example and Learning; and that no Scandal may rest upon the Truth, nor any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62983:92"/> thing be done in ſecret; but all things to the Light brought, that Truth may triumph over all Deceit: and that they who are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Lord, may not by Man be put aſunder, whom the Lord hath joyned together: That there may be a Record in Writing, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing the Day, Place, and Year of ſuch things, to be kept in that Meeting, the which the one, or both of them are Members; under which Writing the Witneſſes may ſubſcribe their Names, or ſo many of them at may be convenient, for the ſtopping of the Mouths of</hi> Gainſayers, <hi>and for the manifeſting of the Truth to all who are without.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſeventh Particular, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſaid recited Epiſtle of <hi>Advice</hi> to the Brethren in the <hi>North,</hi> which in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were twenty: wherein it is manifeſt, what regard they had to the Practice of the Holy Men of God recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and yet by the Concluſion of the ſaid Epiſtle, it is manifeſt, that they were far from limiting Friends, in that Day, to a preſcribed Rule or Form, and that under the greateſt Penalty too, that they were able to inflict; as of late days hath been the Practice of <hi>George Fox</hi> and thoſe of Party with him, as hereafter will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: ſee the Concluſion of the ſaid Letter of <hi>Advice;</hi> which is as followeth, <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Reader my ſee, That in the Beginning, our <hi>Advice</hi> by Letter did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with our publick Teſtimony, and both with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and Evidence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Hearts of the People; to winch our Miniſtring Friends in that Day, both by <hi>Word, Epiſtle,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> deſired to be made manifeſt; for they then did not deſire to exerciſe Dominion <hi>Gentile-like,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Perhaps ſome may expect a great deal of ſincerity under theſe fine Pretences, and that the meaning hereof is to Record the Condemnations of ſuch Perſons as have lived a ſcandalous Life, and broke the Commands of God, diſobeyed the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſt, laid down in the four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or refuſed Obedience to the Doctrine of the holy <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But alas! if I may ſpeak what I have known, and what my Eye hath been a Witneſs of, ever ſince theſe <hi>Cannonical Rules</hi> were made, I muſt ſay the contrary; for let any man ſearch the Records of our <hi>Quarterly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Book in <hi>Hadenham,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and they ſhall there find a Record of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; againſt <hi>John Anſloe,</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and every way (ſo far as ever I heard or knew) of a blameleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, wherein he is recorded out of the Unity; not for any Breach of Chriſt his Commands, or any matter of Evil Fact, but for not taking his Wife according to the Order of Friends <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Intention before the <hi>Womens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as hereafter will be further manifeſt;

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But leſt all this ſhould not do, here is one ſtratagem more; and that is, <hi>To Record thoſe diſobedient Sons, to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> for it is further Enacted by this New arbitrary Authority, who did without the conſent of the People; perhaps forgetting that we are <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall be recorded, and the Condemnation of the <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> of theſe Ordinances and infallible Laws, to which, indiſpenſible Obedience is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; which is partly, and plainly, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truly ſo interpreted; if their Intents may be meaſured by what hath followed, as the event of theſe Things; which this Treatiſe will yet further manifeſt.</p>

                  <p>HAving in the two former Chapters, manifeſted the Way, Manner, and Method of our <hi>Church-Government,</hi> firſt as it was in our primitive Gathering, when as we pleaded to the Magiſtrate for <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience;</hi> ſo we had the free Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it allowed amongſt our ſelves in Matters Spiritual. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to latter Years, when <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is only pleaded for to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> but utterly denyed to be put in practiſe amongſt our ſelves; which I hope may ſerve for a Proof to the Author of the <hi>Accuſer,</hi> &amp;c. and a convincing one too,

                  <p>Was not without ground, when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Forms, Impoſitions, Orders, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Rules, Cannons,</hi> &amp;c. But that it may yet more plainly appear, I ſhall now deſcend to the Proceedings in our own Country, which I am an Eye-Witneſs of, where theſe <hi>Laws, Rules, Cannons,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectories</hi> have been put in practice, on the greateſt Penalties we are capable to inflict; and then perhaps the Author of the <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> may accept of my Endeavours, both for a Proof and Catalogue of the unparrelled ſeverity, according to the State and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city we ſtand in, to the Members of our own Society; conſidering how liable we are to the Perſecution of ſo many penal Statutes every day: yea, I ſay, I know not where to find a Parrellel for our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, our State and Capacity rightly conſidered; we that differ from others, and deſire their Forbearance; yet at the ſame time, differing among our ſelves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nay, will not bear one with another:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62983:106"/> we cry to the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> for the Liberty and the free Exerciſe of our Conſciences in Matters Spiritual; and will not, nay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves not, come what will come, to allow the free Exerciſe of Conſcience in matters Spiritual, to our diſcenting Brethren, as this Treatiſe will make manifeſt. Oh! depth of <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and Fore-runner of <hi>Tyranny;</hi> Should you have Power put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Hands before the Peoples Eyes are a little opened to ſee your Treachery, your double dealing, your antichriſtian dealing?

                  <p>Whereby it is manifeſt, that it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great Evil (if not the leaſt) to call for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> ſince they are accuſtomed to intend it only to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> for themſelves, and not by that Expreſſion to any that ſhall call for it to them.

                        <p>I Having ſince our laſt <hi>Quarterly-Meeting,</hi> weighed and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Recording of <hi>J. A.</hi> and upon a deliberate Conſideration thereof, do find it not <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> nor agreeable with our Profeſſion (at leaſt, in my Apprehenſion) but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62983:109"/> that it rather ſeems to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or Fruit of that Spirit which doth <hi>Apoſtatize,</hi> and draw back into the old compelling <hi>Path,</hi> where Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is exerciſed over the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> of others; which is not a <hi>Doing to others, as we would that others ſhould do unto us.</hi> It is true, I do think that publiſhing our Intentions of <hi>Marriage</hi> is very meet and for my part, if it were my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I know not, but that I ſhould do it as deſired. But that mine, or any other Man, or Mens approbation herein, ſhould be an abſolute Rule for others, under the Penalty of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Recorded to Perpetuity,</hi> I know no reaſon at all: for 'tis my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That no</hi> Impoſition <hi>ought to be upon Mens Conſciences</hi> by any but the Lord: for the Apoſtle in his <hi>Day,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let every Man be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own Conſcience:</hi> and did not go about to force People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to ſuch Things that they were not perſwaded of in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62983:110"/> and whatſoever <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Church:</hi> though they claim <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> that teach a contrary Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine unto this; we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect it to he that haſty driving, and over driving Spirit, that would force a <hi>Faith</hi> where God hath not given it,; <hi>Even like the Church of</hi> Rome, &amp;c. This is my Judgment and Opinion; the which I am very free to communicate to thee, or any one, as not being aſhamed thereof; and if upon thy ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou ſeeſt Cauſe to race out the ſaid <hi>Record,</hi> leſt it prove an ill Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to Poſterity, as well as great Injuſtice to the Party concerned; then I deſire thee peaceably and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to joyn in the racing of it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; foraſmuch as thou hadſt a chief Hand in the obtaining of it, through the Influence thou hadſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Meeting;</hi> and doubtleſs cauſed them to err. But if thou ſhalt ſtand to maintain it, or juſtifie it, then it will ſtand thee upon to appear at the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62983:110"/> next <hi>Quarterly-Meeting,</hi> there to vindicate it by ſound <hi>Arguments;</hi> for many are offended at it, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with it: and by the ſame Spirit that oppoſed the <hi>Papiſts Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian-Impoſitions,</hi> it will be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and withſtood. And this I thought good to let thee know, for divers Reaſons; partly, becauſe thou mayſt conſider of it, and not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; and partly, becauſe thou mayſt not do as ſeveral Biſhops and Teachers have done: who, as ſoon as they have broached any <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as ever more they were the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe thereof, and kindled a flame amongſt the People, then they ſlank away, and ſeldom, or never manfully maintained the ſame, as <hi>Socrates Scholastious, Evſebius,</hi> and <hi>Evagrius Scholasticus,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtorians make mention of in the Church-Hiſtory. Thus in a few Words, I have cleared my Mind thus far: and reſt a Lover of all ſuch as ſerve our Lord Jeſus

                     <p>And whereas you pretend you are for Holy Orders and good Government in the Church, maintain the ſame by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Proof, otherwiſe we ſhall look upon your Pretentions altogether vain, and your plea no better than that which is commonly uſed by the Perſecuting <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and degenerated <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> who when we bid them prove the Uſe of their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and other Obſervations, by plain Scripture, they ſay, <hi>They need not, for the Apoſtle ſaid,</hi> Let things be done decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in order. <hi>And the Church ſeeing a Decency in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of theſe Things, She hath a Power committed to Her, to impoſe them on Her Members, and by Vertue of Her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, She commands the ſtrict Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, under pain of Her Diſpleaſure; and if any will not yield obedience to Her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Orders, when once approved on by a General-Council, or Synodical-Aſſembly, or

                     <p>I might mention the Doctrine and Practice of the Apoſtles, and a <hi>Cloud</hi> of Witneſs, both before and ſince, that they neither did command nor compel <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> in Matters of Conſcience, relating to <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> but I ſhall (upon this occaſion, and at this time) rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Truth which we received in the Beginning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The breaking forth of it was very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, after ſo long a <hi>Night of Darkneſs:</hi> Oh how acceptable was it to my Soul! with many more: It can never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. How contrary was <hi>Compulſion</hi> and <hi>Driving</hi> into <hi>Conformity,</hi> to it? Even as Light is contrary to Darkneſs. Oh how

Every one ſitting under his own <hi>Vine,</hi> and drinking of the <hi>Fountain of Life,</hi> which the Lord hath opened in us, and walking in that Liberty wherewith Chriſt had ſet us free: Not a word of <hi>Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> for many Years, and then we loved one another, even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had loved us, freely for his Names ſake, and went hand in hand together, Serving the Lord, and one another; and the leaſt Breathing that was after God in any, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>How glad were we to ſee the Faces one of another?

This <hi>CONFOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITY</hi> hath been the cauſe of Diviſions and Perſecution in Ages paſt: firſt, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, then Perſecute, and much Innocent Blood hath been ſhed by it: It had its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and is moſt cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the thicheſt Darkneſs, beginning at the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the meaneſt Profeſſion: but I did once think, it could never have crept in amongſt us, at leaſt, ſo ſoon; being ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62983:120"/> many faithful <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> againſt it both in Word and Writing, ſtill freſh in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. But the Enemy of the ſoul of Mankind is buiſie, <hi>NOW,</hi> as in Ages paſt, with his ſubtle Devices, to beguile the Souls of the <hi>Simple,</hi> transforming himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and putting upon him the fineſt Dreſs, in the pureſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Sons of Men can make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, to draw away the Heart from the Lord, from waiting upon him for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Stream of Life and Love, into the dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Puddle of <hi>Conformity,</hi> finding it the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt way of Entrance; having many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretences and fine Coverings.

By the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Shewing, that as we deſired <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from the Magiſtrates,</hi> ſo we allowed it amongſt our ſelves, to each other. By the <hi>Second,</hi> G. F. his <hi>Grant</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> or the Womens <hi>Charter,</hi> granted by <hi>G. F.</hi> for their <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> in their diſtinct Meetings, and the <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> thereof by the <hi>Yearly-Meeting,</hi> Anno 75.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62983:121"/> Whereby <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> is wholly excluded, and a <hi>Degeneracy,</hi> and an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> from our antient Teſtimony, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. By the <hi>Third,</hi> a Proof of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as far as our Power reaches, in the Caſe of <hi>J. A.</hi> whereby the Fruit of ſuch <hi>Synods</hi> is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>I am now come to ſhew how the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony of Friends, and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of many moderate Profeſſors and Biſhops, and Bleſſed Martyrs, which ſtand as Witneſſes againſt the Proceedings of <hi>G. F.</hi> and thoſe of Party with him, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the two laſt Chapters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard Hubborthorn</hi> renders ſeven Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why no <hi>Impoſitions</hi> ought to be upon any Mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> by any, but the Lord alone to have the Government thereof. Two of which I ſhall only tranſcribe for brevities ſake. <hi>See his Works,</hi> p. 188.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe no Man can perſwade the Conſcience of another, either what God is, or how to worſhip him: but only the Spirit which God hath given to inſtruct Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe, to</hi> Impoſe <hi>any thing upon another Mans Conſcience, either to Do or Practiſe, is not,</hi> To do unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he would have another do unto
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62983:121"/> him. <hi>And therefore is contrary to Chriſts Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Reaſons are ſo home to the matter, and ſuch a Demonſtration of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reaſon, as one would think it were impoſſible for any Man; and eſpecially ſuch who ſtill ſeem to have <hi>R. Hubberthorn</hi> in Eſtimation, to deny it; yet being gone from the <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> that was in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are but like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who in words, would highly commend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, garniſh the <hi>Sepulcres of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> who at the ſame time were deviſing how to Perſecute the Bleſſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not <hi>Conform to their Orders, and Outward Obſervations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Next, I ſhall produce ſomewhat out of <hi>F. Howgil's</hi> Works; in p. 614. 616. 617. 620. 625. 626. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> is contradicted by our late Proceedings in our Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>FAith is the Gift of God: there are divers Degrees and Meaſures, according to the Mind and good Pleaſure of the Giver; ſo he that hath received any Meaſure or Degree, muſt not be excluded, as having no Faith, though he attains not to that Degree that ſome do enjoy: and the Apoſtles Doctrine was, <hi>That
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62983:122"/> every one ſhould be fully perſwaded in his own Mind:</hi> and if any were otherewiſe minded, they were to be let alone until God revealed it to them. And whatſoever <hi>PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE</hi> or <hi>CHURCH</hi> (though they claim <hi>Infallibility</hi>) that teach a contrary Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine to this; we have good reaſon to ſuſpect IT to be that HASTY-DRIVING and OVER-DRIVING SPIRIT that would FORCE A FAITH, where God hath not given it.—For we are the Elders of the Church: and we (<hi>ſay the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>and others, too like them</hi>) have the INFALLIBLE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT: and though we make Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Apoſtles made in their day, yet none to queſtion that; the Church was but in its Infancy then, as unwaſhed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadled, and in Perſecution: but now She is grown up to a greater Stature and Power, and endued with greater <hi>Priviledges. And that</hi> (ſay the <hi>Papiſts) may be neceſſary now, that was not neceſſary then,</hi> &amp;c.— And whoſoever brings in, <hi>[Now mark] Set up other Precepts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Orders &amp; Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Point of Worſhip: [And in</hi> Marriage, <hi>and the</hi> Celebration <hi>thereof, there is a point of Worſhip</hi>] in

                     <p>For my part, I am at a ſtand, to ſee how this Mans former Doctrine contradicts his preſent Practice: and if <hi>W.

                     <p>Nay, If all we ſay be true, touching your <hi>Innovations;</hi> as that we ſtand ready to prove, then I ſay, <hi>That 'tis no evil to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch manifeſt Hypocriſy as you are guilty of; What, pretend one thing, &amp; intend another, as your Practice manifests.</hi> Indeed, were they not true, then to publiſh ſuch things, would be great Wickedneſs.

                     <p>Shews the Opinion of ſeveral of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> both Biſhops and Miniſters, to be againſt <hi>Impoſitions;</hi> and the <hi>Impoſers</hi> are the culpable Deviders, and Authors of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HAving throughly proved, and clearly manifected a Change in our</hi> Church-Government, <hi>and ſhewed how our</hi> Cannons <hi>and</hi> Outward Rules <hi>have been Introduced, I am now come to ſhew that the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Biſhops, and others of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>who are conſiderate in their way, and not filled with Prejudice, are againſt Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Conſciences, which cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form nor Submit before Conviction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will begin with Biſhop</hi> Doveman, <hi>who ſpeaking on</hi> Col. <hi>2.20. concerning Rites and Ceremonies; this I took out of a Book, in Anſwer to Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you be free from the Rites that God did
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62983:130"/> preſcribe, then are you free from the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men: It is a moſt wicked thing, they ſhould Impoſe this Yoak upon you; and you are moſt fooliſh to ſubmit your Necks to it: for God would not have aboliſhed the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, Instituted by himſelf, that a New one may be invented by Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet <hi>in his</hi> Iron. <hi>p. 122.</hi> ſaith, Certainly the Primitive Church, that did not charge Mens Faith with ſuch a Load of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as now in theſe latter Ages Men be charged with, would much leſs burthen men <hi>With Impoſing doubtful Practices upon them, as the ground of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Stillingfleets Iron. <hi>120. ſaith,</hi> Let men turn and wind themſelves which way they will, by the very ſame Arguments, that any will prove the Separation from the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> Lawful, becauſe She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unlawful Things, as Conditions of her <hi>Communion;</hi> it will be proved Lawful, not to Conform to any ſuſpected or unlawful Practice required by any Church Governour, upon the ſame Terms. If the thing ſo required be (after ſerious and ſober Inquiry) Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unwarrantable by a Mans own Conſcience,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62983:130"/> and withal, it would be further conſidered, whether, when our beſt Writers do lay the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> NOT on thoſe that withdraw Communion, but on them for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Conditions of Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— whereby they do rather eject Men from their Communion, than the others ſeparate from them.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62983:131"/> BESEECH</hi> you, put on Fatherly Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long ſuffering towards your poor weak Children, and ſo long as they hold fast the Body of Christ, be not ſo rigorous with them for Shaddows, if they ſubmit to you in Subſtance, have patience, though they do not ſubmit in Ceremonies; and give me leave to tell you my poor Opinion, This <hi>VIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENT PRESSING OF CERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONIES</hi> hath <hi>(I humbly conceive)</hi> been a great Hinderance from imbracing them, Men fearing your Intentions to be far worſe than really they are, and therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them.— <hi>And p. 11.</hi> This Force ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Conformity in Worſhip, hath cauſed great Diviſion in Faith, as well as in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for had you, by aboliſhing ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, taken the weak Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Now I beſeech you in the Fear of God, ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Eyes the dreadful Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Chriſt in his Tribunal of Juſtice, ſhall require an account of every Word and Deed, and ſhall thus queſtion you: Here are ſeveral Souls, who taking offence at your Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, have forſaken my Church, forſaken the Faith, have run into Hell the Souls for which I ſhed my precious Blood; why have you ſuffered this? Nay, Why have you occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned this? Will you anſwer, <hi>It was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

Will you for Ceremonies, which you your ſelves confeſs to be indifferent, no way neceſſary unto Salvation, ſuffer your weak Brethren to periſh, for whom I dyed? Have I not ſhewed you how <hi>David</hi> and his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were guiltleſs in eating the <hi>Shew-Bread,</hi> which was not lawful but only for the Prieſt to eat. <hi>David</hi> diſpenced with a Ceremony, commanded by God, to ſatisfie the hunger of his People; Will you not diſpence with your own Ceremonies, to ſatisfie the Souls of my People, who are called by my Name, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my Name, though in weakneſs. Or will you tell Chriſt, <hi>They ought to ſuffer for their own Willfulneſs and Perverſeneſs, who will not ſubmit to the Laws of the Church, as they ought.</hi> Will not Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Shall they periſh for tranſgreſſing your Humane Laws, which they ignorantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Erronious; and ſhall not you periſh for tranſgreſſing my Divine Laws, which you know to be Good and Holy? Had I mercy on you, and ſhould you not have Mercy on your Fellow Servants? <hi>With the ſame meaſure you meet, it ſhall be meaſured to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> I tremble to go further, but moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62983:132"/> beſeech you for Chriſts ſake, endeavour to regain theſe ſtrayed Sheep for which he ſhed his precious Blood, and think it as great an Advantage, as great an Honour to you, as it was unto St <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>BECOME ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN:</hi> That you may gain ſome; doubtleſs you will many, though not all; and the few ſtanding off, will be the more convinced, and at long running, wearied out, and gained alſo.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Miſchief of Impoſitions,</hi> p. 9. For <hi>Paul</hi> in his Admonition to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> lays all the blame of the Separation, not upon them that Seperate, but on thoſe that gave Cauſe to the Separation, <hi>Rom, 16.17. I beſeech you Brethren, mark, thoſe that cauſe Diviſions and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences among you, and avoid them.</hi> Where he points to us theſe three Things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they which cauſe Diviſions, are the culpable Dividers; the <hi>Impoſers</hi> muſt be reſponſable for the Evil Conſequences of their <hi>Impoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is Lawful, nay, a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62983:132"/> to divide from thoſe that unwarrantably give ſuch Cauſe of Diviſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That any Condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Impoſed, <hi>BESIDES,</hi> as well as againſt the Doctrine received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is a ſufficient ground to condemn the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, to juſtifie ſuch as reject ſuch Conditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Pag. <hi>2.</hi> There is nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than to preſs the Neceſſity of <hi>UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON;</hi> and yet at the ſame time continue the neceſſary Cauſes of Diviſion; which ſort of <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> might do well to conſider, That whil'ſt they diſclaim moſt paſſionately againſt the evil of Separation, they do but whip their own Crimes upon their own Backs, and reproach themſelves by railing at other Mens Faults; in which popular Diſcourſes, we hear of nothing but the Prejudice, Paſſion, &amp; Intereſt of thoſe who will not Obey; but not a word, I warrant you, of their own Pride, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and Imperiouſneſs in what they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: always ſtudying and pretending Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Matters ought to be wrong, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offering rational Expedients to ſet what is wrong to rights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miſchief of Impoſitions,</hi> p. <hi>48.</hi> As it is the Duty of all Men to preſerve the Churches Peace, ſo 'tis theirs eſpecially, who have got
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62983:133"/> the Management of things in their Hands, not to lay ſuch dubious Terms in the way of Peace; which they know many Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons cannot get over, but have ever ſtumbled at; for it may be returned with eaſe. It is impoſſible to preſerve Peace, if Men will make ſuch ORDERS, as they know others muſt break; meerly for the Fancy they have taken up, of a Primitive Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Peace be impoſſible to be had upon this account, Who are in the <hi>Fault? Diſſenters</hi> can <hi>Maintain</hi> a Fraternal Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards them, and their Churches, who differ from them in Principle and Practice. If <hi>Impoſers</hi> cannot, or will not diſcharge their Duty reciprocally, we are not Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for their Paſſions, we can love them whether they will or no, though we cannot force them againſt their will, to return that Love and Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Pag. 61. Query.</hi> What must be done by Church-Governours, if Men cannot come up to their Eſtabliſhed Rules? <hi>And thus much of the Anſwer is exceeding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they had better ſit ſtill, and do nothing, than riſe up and do Miſchief; let them do no more Harm than Good, and let them be doing.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:62983:133"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if they must needs have more work to do, let them be ſure they have a Commiſſion from God to do it; leſt; while they do what they ought not to have done, and leave undone thoſe Things they ought to have done, they make their Sins of Commiſſion greater than their Sins of Omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They may do well, among all their Doings, to conſider whether Conſcience be not Gods peculiar, and ſo not within their Precincts, out of their Juriſdiction, and not lyable to their Scitations, Proſſeſſes, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Viſitations: If they will Judge, let them be ſure they be Competent Judges; if they will be buiſie, let them beware it be not in <hi>Alieno Foro.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſaith he, p. 174. <q>Some Men will ſay, <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>hindeth them not, they bind themſelves:</hi> I anſwer, He that bindeth himſelf to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and had rather have his Life and Soul Ruled by the <hi>Popes</hi> Will, than by the Will of God; and by the <hi>Popes</hi> Word, than by the Word of God, is a Fool; and he that had rather be bound than free, is not wiſe; and he that will not abide in the Freedom wherein Chriſt hath ſet us, is alſo mad.</q>

                  <p>I ſay, leſt his Inſinuations ſhould have ſuch an Influence upon any of his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Readers, and thereby be deluded,</p>
                  <p>I have traced him, and in the Reading of <hi>William Tindals</hi> Works, I have found him out, and ſhall, for the right Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reader, relate his Judgment in his own Words, <hi>p.</hi> 252. <hi>Women be no meet Veſſels to</hi> Rule, <hi>or to</hi> Preach <hi>(for both are forbidden them) yet hath God indued them with his Spirit at ſundry times— Do not our Women Chriſten, and Adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm in time of need: might they not by as good Reaſon Preach alſo, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required; if a Woman was driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Iſland where Chriſt was never Preached, might ſhe not there Preach Him,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62983:136"/> if ſhe had the Gift thereto — Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding though God be under no Law, and neceſſity Lawleſs; yet be we under a Law, and ought to preferr the Men before the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Age before Youth, as nigh as we can; for it is againſt the Law of Nature, that Young-Men ſhould Rule, and as uncomly, that Women ſhould Rule the Men.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>And Pag. 313. Tells us what was the Service of Women, in theſe words; <hi>To be a Servant unto the poor People, to dreſs their Meat, waſh their Cloaths, to make their Beds, and ſo forth; and to waſh Strangers Feet, that come out of one Congregation unto another about Buſineſs; and to do all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Service of Love unto their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I think I need not comment upon the difference in all reſpects, betwixt what this worthy Man intended, as by his words are manifeſt, betwixt the Womens Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in thoſe times, and the uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and unlimited Power and Rule that <hi>G. F.</hi> and others have placed in the <hi>Womens-Meetings;</hi> as that none muſt be permitted or ſuffered to Marry, except they Conform, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>Quotation</hi> of <hi>R. R.</hi> this Learned Champion, is as impertinent to his intended Purpoſe, as the <hi>Quotations</hi> of <hi>G. F.</hi> in his little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn

But perhaps ſome may ſay, <hi>There is, being but a few of you, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Multitude that will not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for they can out Vote you three to one, ſo that we are apt to think God will not ſuffer ſo many to Err, or any more a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Apoſtacy.</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62983:137"/> Erred, and been faithleſs theſe 800 years; and the <hi>Jews</hi> believe this Day, as much as ever the Carnal ſort of them ever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Moved alſo by the Authority of their Elders ONLY; and think it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to Err, being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and being the Children of them to whom the Promiſes of all that we believe, was made; and yet they have Erred, and been faithleſs, this 1500 years: and we of like Blindneſs believe ONLY by the Authority of our Elders. <q>And of like Pride think that we cannot Err, being ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and yet we ſee how God in the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi> did let the great multitude Err; reſerving always a little Flock to call the other back again, and to teſtifie unto them the <hi>RIGHT-WAY.</hi>

                        <p>THeſe Lines are to put you in Mind, that many Friends belonging to our Meeting, as well as in divers other Places, are offended and burthened by reaſon of the continued Record againſt <hi>John Anſloe,</hi> which exclude him what in you lye, out of the Unity of Friends, which is nothing leſs than <hi>Excommunication</hi> to the utmoſt of your Power, whereby we are conſtrained to viſit you in this manner, entreating you to race out the ſaid Record out of your <hi>Quarterly Book.</hi> Indeed had <hi>J. A.</hi> denyed Marriage, (the very forbidding of which is a Doctrine of Devils) you might juſtly have thrown him out; for Marriage is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62983:142"/> Gods Ordinance. But the Controverſy is not here, but about manifeſting his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Marry. Behold the Crime (as you account it) and conſider of it, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, for Peace ſake, and lay not ſuch a Streſs, where Chriſt, nor his Primitive Followers laid none. And that thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you may be encouraged, ponder the ſaying of <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Addreſs to Prot.</hi> p. 77. <hi>I beſeech you</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and Love of Jeſus Chriſt, ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in his moſt precious Blood,</hi> FLY ROME AT ROME. <hi>Look to the Enemies of your own Houſe, have a care of this Preſumption, carry it not too high, lay not Streſs where God hath laid none.—The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſuch Opinions is the Priviledge of Hypocrites, and the Snare of many honeſt Minds.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 93. <hi>If we conſider the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well,</hi> I fear (ſaith <hi>W. P.) it will be found that the occaſion of Diſturbance in the Church of Chriſt, hath in moſt Ages been found to lye on the Side of thoſe who have had the greateſt Sway in it.</hi> And Pag. 94. <hi>If the Spiritual Guides and Fathers of the Church, would be a little ſparing of incumbring Churches with needleſs Superſluities.—there were far leſs danger of</hi> Schiſm <hi>and</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. And Pag. 144. <hi>Nay, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to whom all Power was given in Heaven
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62983:143"/> and Earth, ſubmitted himſelf to the Teſt: He did not require them to believe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would be believed, he refers them to the Witneſs that God bore of him;</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not true. <hi>He alſo ſends them to the Scriptures;—but an Impoſing Church bears witneſs of her ſelf, and will be both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Judge, require Aſſent without Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Faith without Proof, therefore falſe. But Chriſtian Religion ought to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on only by that way, by which it was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, which was Perſwaſion;</hi> If any Man will be my Diſciple; let him take up his Croſs, and follow me. Pag. 146. <hi>For if I believe what the Church believes, only beauſe She believes, and not becauſe I am convinced in my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Truth of what She believes, my Faith is falſe, though hers be true. I ſay, 'tis not true to me, I have no Evidence of it.</hi> And Pag. 141. <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle became all unto all, that he might win ſome; but this is becoming all unto none, to force all; he therefore recomends the utmoſt Condiſcention that can be lawful;— he ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed— he became all unto all, that is, he ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Capacities, and humbled himſelf to thoſe Degrees of Knowledge that Men had, and valued that which was good in all; — Theſe Allurements were all his Injunctions;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62983:143"/> nay, in this Caſe he makes it an Injunction to uſe no other;</hi> Let us therefore <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> as many as be perfect, be thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you: you ſhall not be Impoſed upon, Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, or Excommunicated for want of full ſatisfaction, or becauſe you do not conſent before Conviction.— Thus far <hi>William Penn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let us a little animadvert upon this Noble Mans Words; <hi>Lay no Streſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where God hath not laid Streſs:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Friends, God never laid any ſuch Streſs about publiſhing the Intent of Marriage, Why then do you?</hi> Have a care of this Preſumption, carry not things too high, neither Smite, Record, nor Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate one another about ſuch Things, which are at beſt but Mens Traditions and Impoſitions, which may prove a Snare to the Honeſt and Conſcientious, but a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priviledge to the conformable <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:</hi> for you ſee that ſuch as have the greateſt Sway in the Church, are evermore the cauſe of theſe Diſturbances, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves Fathers and Spiritual Guides, are not ſparing of cumbring the Churches with needleſs Superfluities, and ſuch Orders as Chriſt never commanded,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62983:144"/> nor his Apoſtles ever practiſed; which had they been ſo uſeful as you pretend they be, ſurely Chriſt and his Apoſtles would not have been ſo forgetful of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſuch Outward Obſervations: nay, but on the contrary, they have told us in Holy Writ, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven comes not that way, neither conſiſts in ſuch things.</hi> You alſo may perceive that Chriſt was ſuch an Example of Meekneſs and Self-denyal, and ſo far and free from Force and Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he only ſaid, <hi>If any Man will be my Diſcipie, let him take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me;</hi> but an Impoſing Church bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſelf: and though She ſets up ſuch Orders as Chriſt never commanded, yet She requires aſſent without Evidence, and Faith without Proof, for She will be both Party and Judge, and Recorder out of the Unity at her pleaſure, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts her to be the falſe Church; for the true Chriſtian Religion was introduced by Perſwaſion, and ought to be ſo carryed on; for if I believe and practice only becauſe the Church doth ſo, ad not from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement in my ſelf, my Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience would be falſe and Idolatrous: The Apoſtles, who had the Mind of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all unto all, ſtooped to all Capacities, to all Degrees of Knowledge, valued what
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62983:144"/> was good in all; theſe were his Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who ſaid, <hi>As every Man is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, ſo let him walk, for what is not of Faith, is Sin:</hi> He did not Record out of the Unity ſuch as ſaw not ſo clear as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but became all unto all, that he might ſave ſome; but you that would force all, become all to none; you will not ſtoop at all, nor condiſcend at all, but exalt and magnifie your Orders and written Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, how many weak Brethren ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you offend. You value not the good in any, but Conformity to your Humour, and to your Will; and though ſome are otherwiſe minded about Diſcipline and Church-Government, you will not let them alone, but you will impoſe upon them, Stigmatiſe, and Record them out of the Unity, which is no leſs than Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Wherefore take <hi>W. P</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>FLY ROME AT HOME and lay not Streſs where God lays not Streſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus twice over, as it were, have you herein the genuine ſenſe of <hi>Dear W. P.</hi> And, Oh! that every one concerned would make a diligent ſearch in his own Heart, and like the beloved Diſciple, ſmite upon his Breaſt, and ſay, <hi>Is it I, Is it I that am guilty of this Severity, of this Preſumption,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62983:145"/> if carrying things too high, of ſetting up ſuch Orders as prove a Snare, or at leaſt, a burthen to the Conſcientious; yea, of laying a Streſs; and a great Streſs where God never laid any, One that am the Cauſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the Church; One that bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſelf, and that will be both Party and Judge? Oh! let me a little Examine my ſelf; Am I One that cannot become all unto all; One that cannot condiſcend at all to my Brother; One that will value not the good in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but Conformity to my Will and Humour; One that would have all believe and practice as I do, whether I convince their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth of what I believe and practice, or not; and if not, condemn them for</hi> Hereticks, <hi>without any more a do?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay, Oh that every one would thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon himſelf, that ſo you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe things, for many are offended and grieved with the continuance of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned Record againſt <hi>J. A.</hi> And again beſeech and intreat you to reverſe the ſame, that ſo Love and Good-will, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Concord may ſpring amongſt us as in the Beginning, which is heartily deſired by your Friends, who ſubſcribe their names hereunto.</p>

                        <p>Thy Lines, I look upon impertinent, and in ſeveral places, falſe and unſound.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62983:172"/> paſſest Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as for us, who are in Scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, <hi>Not</hi> under Colour, but in the Reality of our Hearts, the Lord is our Witneſs. Whether we be the People againſt whom the late Act was made, or no, remaines a Queſtion? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Preamble of the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> it is ſaid to be, <hi>For the ſuppreſſing of ſuch who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretence of Tender Conſciences, may contrive Inſurrections,</hi> &amp;c. Or words to that purpoſe: which we are clear of, Bleſſed be the Lord, having not the leaſt Evil Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Heart againſt the King, nor the Preſent Government Eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding we are clear from the Facts therein provided againſt, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently free from the Puniſhment therein preſcribed; for the Fact is the Cauſe of the Penalty: Yet notwithſtanding there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are willing ſo largely to conſtrue it, as to stretch it to us, having nothing whereof juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accuſe us, ſave concerning the Law and Worſhip of our God: and whether the Justices be informed against us, we certainly cannot tell: Yet this we know, that whereas the Law ſays, <hi>We ſhould be firſt Convicted:</hi> We never were ſo much as brought before them, to hear our <hi>Accuſers,</hi> and anſwer for our
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62983:173"/> ſelves a Priviledge not denyed <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> nor us, in ſome Places, where they have any reſpect to Juſtice.— And thus are we diſinabled to go on with our ſeveral Imployments, through the falſe Conſtruction of thoſe who are not willing, <hi>To do, as they would that others ſhould do to them:</hi> By whoſe meanes our Cloth, both <hi>Wooling</hi> and <hi>Linning,</hi> our <hi>Stuffs,</hi> our <hi>Peuter</hi> and <hi>Braſs, Boots</hi> and <hi>Shoes,</hi> are taken out of our Shops, we being of ſeveral Trades; yea, our <hi>Feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds</hi> from under us, with other Bedding and Houſhold Goods.

                        <p>Oh that ever Judgment ſhould thus be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backward, as we have juſt Cauſe to ſay it is, and Juſtice find no Place in the Hearts of thoſe who profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> ſurely if <hi>Turks, Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to deal thus with us, it would be no other Cruelty than what we ſhould expect at their hands.

Likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three years after, many of us were Sufferers in this Town of <hi>Milden-hall,</hi> at which time I wrote a Letter to Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> who was a very courteous man, who received my Letter at my Wifes Hand, and read it; and ſaid, <hi>Truly, Sweetheart, the Execution of this Law is left with the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and is out of our Power, but if I could do you any good, I would.</hi> My Wife replyed, <hi>That ſhe did not queſtion, but that if he did but ſpeak to the Juſtices, they would hear him:</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>He would, and much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he ſhewed her,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:62983:174"/>
                  <p>One Inſtance more I will mention of this Nature; and that is in <hi>April</hi> 78. (as I remember) my ſelf, and four or five Friends of our Town, were convict of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy,</hi> and Perſecuted, in order to ſeize our <hi>Free-Hold.</hi> And upon a time I being at <hi>Norwich,</hi> on the account of my Trade; when I came home, my Wife told me that here had been the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> and his <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> and had Impanelled a <hi>Jury of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> of the value of our Eſtates, who ſtood Convicted as aforeſaid in this Town; and the <hi>Jury</hi> had found us, ſome more, ſome leſs; yet moderately, as not knowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what we had clear, and further they were not oblieged to find: ſo I forthwith wrote a Letter to Sir <hi>Henry North,</hi> Knight [ſo called] who lived in our Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London,</hi> and acquainted him with the nature of their Proceedings; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying to me, <hi>You are deluded, Why do you not Conform to our Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin,</hi> &amp;c? I ſay, inſtead of this, he took ſuch care, as that not only my ſelf, and thoſe Friends of our own Town, but he took off all our Friends that we knew of (who ſtood in the ſame Jeopardy) in theſe Parts of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> ſo that at preſent, I Bleſs God, we live a quiet Life, and free from Diſturbance. And Bleſſed be the Lord
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62983:174"/> for putting it into the Hearts of the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and Men in Authority, to ſhew Mercy, when otherwiſe they have Power enough to Oppreſs and Spoil many Families. And I further deſire, that a Bleſſing may reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſuch who Act in Moderation, and are willing to do as they would be done by: for all men would have their <hi>Liberty,</hi> there are none would be Impos'd upon, contrary to their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall turn to the Biſhops of the <hi>Proteſtant-Churches,</hi> and do not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſhall make it appear, that they (their Power conſidered, and that the Laws are on their Sides) are more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, &amp; uſe not that Severity to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Church (although they are ſevere enough too) that <hi>George Fox,</hi> and thoſe of Party with him, uſe to the poor <hi>Quakers,</hi> if they chance to tranſgreſs their <hi>Traditions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Now if I thought the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> would take Example againſt the poor <hi>Bookſellers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> for diſperſing any Book that ſpeaks againſt the <hi>Cannons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I ſhould then repent that I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this Antichriſtian Piece of Work: But as the <hi>Jews</hi> were more zealous for their own <hi>Traditions,</hi> than for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and the <hi>Papists</hi> more zealous for their heap of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> than for Holy Scriptures; as Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> in his <hi>Sermon,</hi> Preached, <hi>November</hi> the 5th. 1678, at St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, p. 4. 9. 16. ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently makes appear, and which I was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to tranſcribe, as pertinent to my preſent occaſion; but Brevity conſtrains me to leave it out, it being ſomewhat large.

                  </head>
                  <p>AS it was the manner of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to propound Inſnaring Queſtions to Chriſt Jeſus in the Day of his Fleſh; tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, endeavouring to entangle him in his Talk, when otherwiſe they were not able to Confute him. Even ſo hath it been the manner of ſome amongſt us, to come to me, ſince I ſent the forgoing in <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> to the <hi>Preſs:</hi> Queſtioning me, in order to inſnare or intangle me in my Talk, inſtead of proving their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and their Force and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion in their Church Procedure, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable: WHEREFORE my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advice to the Reader, is, To frequent the Holy Scriptures, and read them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; as alſo the Works of <hi>R. Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62983:184"/> F. Howgil,</hi> &amp; other Antient Friends, and the foregoing Tract; and then ſee and conſider whether there be not Violence done to our firſt Principles of Union, whereby <hi>Tyranny</hi> inſtead of <hi>Order</hi> is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                  <p>For it is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle, to read all Authors, to ſearch out the Truth of Things in Controverſy, to endeavour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a right Underſtanding, to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good; and hereby will <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> and <hi>Blind Obedience</hi> be excluded, <hi>Knowledge</hi> increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and true <hi>Conviction</hi> become the ground of our Conformity, and the <hi>Bereans</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple become our daily Practice. But it is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle, <hi>To believe as the Church believes, barely becauſe She ſo believes:</hi> to take all for granted our Leaders ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further Examination, to read no Books, but what are Licenced and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on by this <hi>General Council,</hi> or that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-Days Meeting,</hi> to Pin my Faith on their Sleeves, to ſee with their Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of my own. Oh this <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> this <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> this Idolizing the Wiſdom and Conduct of the Multitude, and refuſing the uſe of our own Reaſon, Senſe and Underſtanding, is no leſs than
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62983:185"/> the Product of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle, and ought to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Object. But ſome may object, and ſay, <hi>That although things be thus (which being upon Record, cannot without great Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, be denyed) yet to publiſh them, we think very hard meaſure,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If no private meanes had been uſed, then indeed this <hi>Objection</hi> had been of ſome weight; but in regard ſo many private Endeavours have been uſed for four Years together, and all avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is but juſt and equal, as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</p>
                  <p>Let any of the Hearers be found guilty of Miſdemeanors (although no other Crimes than the Leaders and Teachers themſelves are guilty of) it is uſual to go to ſuch and admoniſh them if they perſiſt in the Evil, then admoniſh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and if after all private Meanes they will not be reclaimed, then it hath been uſual to give out Papers of Condemnation againſt them, that the World may ſee we do not own them in their evil Practices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even ſo it is but juſt and reaſonable, that if our Leaders and Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62983:185"/> as (they count themſelves) who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſee for the Body, ſhall Erect ſuch a way of <hi>Church-Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> as neither Chriſt nor his bleſſed Apoſtles never commanded nor Practiſed, and bring in and ſet up other Traditions than the Apoſtles delivered; and then compel (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that little Power they have) a Uniformity and Conformity to them; then it is but juſt to call theſe Leaders to account, and admoniſh them again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſhew them their Errour, and the Miſchief of their <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> and if after all private Endeavours, for three or four Year together, theſe <hi>Church-Governours</hi> will not be reclaimed, nor in any wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to make void ſuch Edicts, ſuch vain Traditions and uſeleſs Ceremonies; nor yet be content that as many as have freedom to uſe them, may, and that others that are otherwiſe minded, may be let alone, and left to their Chriſtian-Liberty, whether to Conform, or not Conform; then it is but juſt to bear a Publick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them, their <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> their Preſcribed <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Cannons,</hi> their <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Orders,</hi> their Antichriſtian way of <hi>Church-Procedure;</hi> that the World may know we do not own them; and that <hi>G.F.
